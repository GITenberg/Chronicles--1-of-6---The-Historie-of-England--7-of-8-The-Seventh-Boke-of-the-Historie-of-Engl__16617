<h3>THE FIRST CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">EGELRED.</span>
In the former booke was discoursed the troubled state of this land by the manifold and
mutinous inuasions of the Danes; who though they sought to ingrosse the rule of euerie
part and parcell therof into their hands; yet being resisted by the valiantnesse of the gouernors
supported with the aid of their people, they were disappointed of their expectation,
and receiued manie a dishonorable or rather reprochfull repulse at their aduersaries hands.
Much mischiefe doubtlesse they did, and more had doone, if they had not béene met withall
in like measure of extremitie as they offred, to the offense and ouerthrow of great multitudes.
Their first entrance into this land is controuersed among writers, some saieng that it was in
the daies of king Britricus, other some affirming that it was in the time of king Egbert, &amp;c:
about which point (sith it is a matter of no great moment) we count it labour lost to vse
manie woords: onelie this by the waie is notewoorthie, that the Danes had an vnperfect
or rather a lame and limping rule in this land, so long as the gouernors were watchfull,
diligent, politike at home, and warlike abroad. But when these kind of kings discontinued,
and that the raines of the regiment fell into the hands of a pezzant not a puissant prince, a
man euill qualified, dissolute, slacke and licentious, not regarding the dignitie of his owne
person, nor fauoring the good estate of the people; the Danes who before were coursed
from coast to coast, and pursued from place to place, as more willing to leaue the land, than
desirous to tarrie in the same; tooke occasion of stomach and courage to reenter this Ile,
&amp; waxing more bold and confident, more desperate and venturous, spared no force, omitted
no opportunitie, let slip no aduantage that they might possiblie take, to put in practise and
fullie to accomplish their long conceiued purpose.</p>
<p>
Now bicause the Danes in the former kings daies were reencountred (and that renowmedlie)<a name="page703" id="page703"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;703]</span>
so often as they did encounter, and séeking the totall regiment, were dispossessed
of their partile principalitie, which by warlike violence they obteined; and for that
the Saxons were interessed in the land, and these but violent incrochers, vnable to kéepe
that which they came to by constreint; we haue thought it conuenient to comprise the
troubled estate of that time in the sixt booke; the rather for the necessarie consequence of
matters then in motion: and héere déeme it not amisse, at so great and shamefull loosenesse
(speciallie in a prince) ministring hart and courage to the enimie, to begin the seuenth
booke. Wherin is expressed the chiefest time of their flourishing estate in this land; if in
tumults, vprores, battels, and bloudshed, such a kind of estate may possiblie be found. For
héere the Danes lord it, heere they take vpon them like souereignes, &amp; héere (if at anie time
they had absolute authoritie) they did what they might in the highest degrée: as shall be
declared in the vnfortunate affaires of vngratious Egelred or Etheldred, the sonne of king
Edgar, and of his last wife queene Alfred, who was ordeined king in place of his brother
Edward, after the same Edward was dispatched out of the waie, and began his reigne ouer
<span class="rightnote">979. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
this realme of England, in the yéere of our Lord 979, which was in the seuenth yéere of the
emperor Otho the second, in the 24 of Lothaire K. of France, and about the second or third
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
yeere of Kenneth the third of that name king of Scotland.</p>
<p>
This Egelred or Etheldred was the 30 in number from Cerdicus the first king of the
Westsaxons: through his negligent gouernment, the state of the commonwealth fell into
such decaie (as writers doo report) that vnder him it may be said, how the kingdome was
come to the vttermost point or period of old and féeble age, which is the next degrée to the
graue. For wheras, whilest the realme was diuided at the first by the Saxons into sundrie
dominions, it grew at length (as it were increasing from youthfull yeeres) to one absolute
monarchie, which passed vnder the late remembred princes, Egbert, Adelstane, Edgar, and
others, so that in their daies it might be said, how it was growne to mans state, but now
vnder this Egelred, through famine, pestilence, and warres, the state thereof was so shaken,
turned vpside downe, and weakened on ech part, that rightlie might the season be likened
vnto the old broken yéeres of mans life, which through féeblenesse is not able to helpe it
selfe. Dunstane archbishop of Canturburie was thought to haue foreséene this thing, and
therfore refused to annoint Egelred king, which by the murther of his brother should atteine
to the gouernment: but at length he was compelled vnto it, and so he consecrated
him at Kingston vpon Thames, as the maner then was, on the 24 day of Aprill, assisted by
Oswald archbishop of Yorke, and ten other bishops.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Will. Malmes.</i></span>
But (as hath béene reported) Dunstane then said that the English people should suffer
condigne punishment generallie, with losse of ancient liberties, which before that time they
had inioied. Dunstane also long before prophesied of the slouthfulnesse that should remaine
in this Egelred. For at what time he ministred the sacrament of baptisme to him;
shortlie after he came into this world, he defiled the font with the ordure of his wombe (as
hath beene said:) whervpon Dunstane being troubled in mind, "By the Lord (saith he)
and his blessed mother, this child shall prooue to be a slouthfull person." It hath beene
written also, that when he was but ten yeeres of age, and heard that his brother Edward
was slaine, he so offended his mother with wéeping, bicause she could not still him, that
hauing no rod at hand, she tooke tapers or sizes that stood before hir, and beat him so sore
with them, that she had almost killed him, whereby he could neuer after abide to haue anie
such candels lighted before him.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
This Egelred (as writers say) was nothing giuen to warlike enterprises, but was slouthfull,
a louer of idlenesse, and delighting in riotous lusts, which being knowne to all men, caused
him to be euill spoken of amongst his owne people, and nothing feared amongst strangers.
<span class="leftnote"><i>Ran. Higd.</i> 980.</span>
Heerevpon the Danes that exercised rouing on the seas, began to conceiue a boldnesse of
courage to disquiet and molest the sea-coasts of the realme, in so much that in the second
yéere of this Egelreds reigne, they came with seuen ships on the English coasts of Kent, and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
spoiled the Ile of Tenet, the towne of Southampton, and in the yeere following they destroied<a name="page704" id="page704"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;704]</span>
S. Petroks abbeie in Cornwall, Porthland in Deuonshire, and diuerse other places by
the sea side, speciallie in Deuonshire &amp; Cornwall. Also a great part of Cheshire was destroied
by pirats of Norway.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote">982.</span>
The same yéere by casualtie of fire, a great part of the citie of London was burnt. In
<span class="rightnote">983. <br />Alfer or Elfer duke of Mercia departed this life.</span>
the yeere of our Lord 983, Alfer duke of Mercia departed this life, who was coosen to king
<span class="leftnote">Alfrike or Elfrike duke of Mercia. <br /><i>Fabian. <br />Wil. Malm.
<br />Matt. West.</i></span>
Edgar, &amp; his sonne Alfrike tooke vpon him the rule of that dukedome, and within thrée
yéeres after was banished the land. About the eight yéere of his reigne, Egelred maried
one Elgina or Ethelgina, daughter of earle Egbert. In the ninth yeere of his reigne, vpon
occasion of strife betwéene him and the bishop of Rochester, he made warre against the
same bishop, wasted his lordships, and besieged the citie of Rochester, till Dunstan procured
the bishops peace with paiment of an hundred pounds in gold. And bicause the K. would
not agrée with the bishop without moneie at the onelie request of Dunstane, the said Dunstane
did send him woord, that sithens he made more account of gold than of God, more
of monie than of S. Andrew, patrone of the church of Rochester, and more of couetousnesse
than of him being the archbishop, the mischiefs which the Lord had threatned would
shortlie fall and come to passe, but the same should not chance whilest he was aliue, who
died in the yéere following, on the 25 of Maie, being saturdaie.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Vita Dunstani.</i></span>
Of this Dunstane manie things are recorded by writers, that he should be of such holinesse
and vertue, that God wrought manie miracles by him, both whilest he liued heere on
<span class="leftnote"><i>Iohn Capgr. <br />Osborne. <br />Ran. Higd.</i></span>
earth, and also after his deceasse. He was borne in Westsaxon, his father was named
Heorstan, and his mother Cinifride, who in his youth set him to schoole, where he so profited,
that he excelled all his equals in age. Afterward he fell sicke of an ague, which
vexed him so sore that it draue him into a frensie: and therefore his parents appointed him
to the cure and charge of a certeine woman, where his disease grew so on him, that he fell
in a trance, as though he had béene dead, and after that he suddenlie arose, &amp; by chance
caught a staffe in his hand, and ran vp and downe through hils and dales, and laid about
him as though he had béene afraid of mad dogs. The next night (as it is said) he gat him
to the top of the church (by the helpe of certeine ladders that stood there for woorkemen to
mend the roofe) and there ran vp and downe verie dangerouslie, but in the end came
safelie downe, and laid him to sléepe betwéene two men that watched the church that night,
&amp; when he awaked, he maruelled how he came there. Finallie, recouering his disease, his
parents made him a priest, and placed him in the abbeie of Glastenburie, where he gaue
himselfe to the reading of scriptures and knowledge of vertue. But as well his kinsmen as
certeine other did raise a report of him, that he gaue not himselfe so much to the reading of
scriptures, as to charming, coniuring and sorcerie, which he vtterlie denied: howbeit learned
he was in déed, &amp; could doo manie pretie things both in handie woorke and other deuises:
he had good skill in musicke and delighted much therein. At length he grew in such
fauour, that he was aduanced into the seruice of king Adelstane.</p>
<p>
Vpon a time, as he came to a gentlewomans house with his harpe, and hoong the same
on the wall, while he shaped a priests stole, the harpe suddenlie began to plaie a psalme,
which draue the whole houshold in such feare, that they ran out and said, he was too
cunning, and knew more than was expedient: wherevpon he was accused of necromancie,
and so banished out of the court. After this he began to haue a liking to women, and
when Elfeagus then bishop of Winchester and his coosen, persuaded him to become a moonke,
he refused it, for he rather wished to haue maried a yoong damesell, whose pleasant companie
he dailie inioied. But being soone after striken with such a swelling disease in his
bellie, that all his bodie was brought into such state, as though he had béene infected with a
foule leprosie, he bethought him selfe, and vpon his recouerie sent to the bishop, who immediatlie
shore him a moonke, in which life he liued in so great opinion of holinesse, as he
in time became abbat of Glastenburie: where on a time as he was in his praiers before the
altar of S. George, he fell asléepe: and imagining in his dreame, that an vglie rough beare
came towards him with open mouth, and set his forefeet vpon his shoulders readie to deuoure<a name="page705" id="page705"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;705]</span>
him, he suddenlie wakening for feare, caught his walking staffe which he commonlie
went with, and laid about him, that all the church rang thereof, to the great woonder of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polychron.</i></span>
such as stood by. The common tale of his plucking the diuell by the nose with a paire of
pinsors, for tempting him with women, while he was making a chalice: the great loue that
the ladie Elfleda néere kinswoman to king Adelstane bare him to hir dieng day, with a
great manie of other such like matters, I leaue as friuolous, and wholie impertinent to our
purpose: onelie this I read, that through declaring of his dreames and visions, he obteined
in the time of king Edgar, first the bishoprike of Worcester, after of London, &amp; last of all
the archbishoprike of Canturburie. But leauing Dunstane and the fond deuises depending
vpon the commemoration of his life, we will now returne to the dooings of Egelred, and
speake of such things in the next chapter as chanced in his time.</p>

<h3>THE SECOND CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malm. <br />Matt. Westm.</i> <br />The Danes inuade this land.</span>
Shortlie after the decease of Dunstane, the Danes inuaded this realme on each side,
wasting and spoiling the countrie in most miserable wise. They arriued in so manie places
at once, that the Englishmen could not well deuise whither to go to encounter first with
<span class="leftnote"><i>Alias</i> Wecederport.  <br /><i>H. Hunt. <br />Simon Dun.</i></span>
them. Some of them spoiled a place or towne called Wichport, and from thence passing
further into the countrie, were met with by the Englishmen, who giuing them battell, lost
their capteine Goda: but yet they got the victorie, and beat the Danes out of the field, and
<span class="rightnote">Danes vanquished. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
so that part of the Danish armie was brought to confusion. Simon Dunel. saith, that the

(who by report of the same author was Earle of Deuonshire) there died an other valiant
man of warre named Strenwold. In the yeere 991, Brightnod earle of Essex, at Maldon
gaue battell to an armie of Danes (which vnder their leaders Iustine and Guthmond had
spoiled Gipswich) and was there ouercome and slaine with the most part of his people, and so
the Danes obteined in that place the victorie.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>991.</i></span>
In the same yéere, and in the 13 yeere of, king Egelreds reigne, when the land was on
each side sore afflicted, wasted and haried by the Danes, which couered the same as they had
béene grashoppers: by the aduise of the archbishop of Canturburie Siricius (which was the
second of that sée after Dunstane) a composition was taken with the Danes, so that for the
<span class="rightnote">Ten thousand pounds paid to the Danes.  <br />Danegilt.</span>
sum of ten thousand pounds to be paied to them by the king, they should couenant not to
trouble his subjects anie further. This monie was called Danegilt or Dane monie, and was
leuied of the people. Although other take that to be Danegilt, which was giuen vnto such
Danes as king Egelred afterwards reteined in his seruice, to defend the land from other Danes
and enimies that sought to inuade his dominions. But by what name so euer this monie<a name="page706" id="page706"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;706]</span>
(which the Danes now receiued) was called, true it is that herevpon they ceassed from their
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malm.</i> <br />992.</span>
most cruell inuasions for a time. But shortlie after they had refreshed themselues, and recouered
new strength, they began to play their old parts againe, dooing the like mischéefe
by their semblable inuasions, as they had vsed before. By reason hereof such feare came
vpon the English people, that they despaired to be able to resist the enimies.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hen. Hunt.</i> <br />A nauie set forth.</span>
The king yet caused a nauie to be set foorth at London, whereof he appointed earle
Alfrike (whome before he had banished) to be high admerall, ioining with him earle Turold.
This nauie did set forward from London toward the enimies, who hauing warning giuen
them from Alfrike, escaped away without hurt. Shortly after a greater nauie of the Danes
came, and incountered with the kings fléet, so that a great number of the Londoners were
<span class="rightnote">Alfrike a traitour to his countrie. <br /><i>Matth. West.</i></span>
slaine, and all the kings ships taken: for Alfrike like a traitor turned to the Danes side.
¶ Matt. West, maketh other report of this matter, declaring that Alfrike in déed being one
of the chiefe capteins of the fléet, aduertised them by forewarning of the danger that was
toward them, and that when they should come to ioining, the same Alfrike like a traitor
fled to the Danes, and after vpon necessitie being put to flight escaped away with them: but
the other capteins of the kings fléet, as Theodred, Elstan, and Escwen, pursued the Danes,
tooke one of their ships, and slue all those that were found therein. The Londoners also
(as the same Matt. West, saith) met with the nauie of the Danish rouers as they fled away,
and slue a great number, and also tooke the ship of the traitor Alfrike with his souldiers
&amp; armor, but he himselfe escaped, though with much paine, hauing plaied the like traitorous
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hen. Hunt.</i> <br />The son punished for his fathers offense. <br />993.</span>
part once before, and yet was reconciled to the kings fauor againe. Vpon this mischiefe
wrought by the father, the king now tooke his sonne Algar, and caused his eies to be put
out.</p>
<p>
About the same time was Bambrough destroied by the Danes, which arriued after in
Humber, and wasted the countrie of Lindsey and Yorkeshire, on either side that riuer.
And when the Englishmen were assembled to giue them battell, before they ioined, the capteines
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon Dun. <br />Polydor. <br />Matth. West.</i></span>
of the English armie, Frena, Godwin, and Fredegist, that were Danes by their fathers
side began to flie away, and escaped, so giuing the occasion of the ouerthrow that lighted
on their people. But by some writers it should appéere, that after the Danes had destroied
all the north parts, as they spred abroad without order and good arraie, the people of the
<span class="rightnote">Aulafe king of Norway, &amp; Swein king of Denmarke were
capteins of this fléet, as saith <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i> <br />994</span>
countrie fell vpon them, and slue some of them, and chased the residue. Other of the
Danes with a nauie of 94 ships entered the Thames, and besieged London about our ladie
daie in September. They gaue a verie sore assault to the citie, and assaied to set it on fire:
but the citizens so valiantlie defended themselues, that the Danes were beaten backe and
repelled, greatlie to their losse, so that they were constreined to depart thence with dishonor.
Then they fell to and wasted the countries of Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Hamshire,
and ceassed not till they had inforced the king to compound with them for 16 thousand
<span class="leftnote"><i>Hen Hunt. <br />Wil. Malm.</i> <br />The king compounded with the Danes for monie.
<br /><i>Matt. West. <br />Simon Dun.</i> <br />Aufale king of Norwey baptised. <br />His promise.</span>
pounds, which he was glad to pay to haue peace with them.</p>
<p>
Moreouer, whereas they wintered that yéere at Southampton, the king procured Aulafe
king of the Norwegians to come vnto Andeuer (where at that time he lay) vpon pledges
receiued of the king for his safe returne. Elphegus bishop of Winchester, and duke Ethelwold
were appointed by king Egelred to bring Aulafe vnto him in most honorable maner.
The same time was Aulafe baptised, king Egelred receiuing him at the fontstone, and so he
promised neuer after to make anie war within this land. And receiuing great gifts of the
king, he returned into his countrie, and kept his promise faithfullie: but the euils tooke not
so an end, for other of the Danes sprang vp, as they had béene the heads of the serpent
Hydra, some of them euer being readie to trouble the quiet state of the English nation.

<h3>THE THIRD CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
In the nineenth yere of king Egelreds reigne, the Danes sailed about Cornewall, and
<span class="rightnote">997. <br />The Danes inuade the west parts of this land.</span>
comming into the Seuerne sea, they robbed &amp; tooke preies in the coasts of Deuonshire &amp;
Southwales, and landing at Wicheport, they burned vp the countrie, and came about vnto
Penwithstréet on the south coast, and so arriuing in the mouth of Tamer water, came vnto
Lidford, and there wasted all afore them with force of fire. They burned, amongst other
<span class="leftnote">Tauestocke.</span>
places, the monasterie of saint Ordulfe at Essingstocke. After this they came into Dorcetshire,
and passed through the countrie with flame and fire, not finding anie that offered to resist
them. The same yéere also they soiourned in the Ile of Wight, and liued vpon spoiles &amp;
<span class="rightnote">998.</span>
preies which they tooke in Hampshire and Sussex. At length they came into the Thames,
<span class="leftnote">999. <br />The Danes arriue in the Thames.</span>
and so by the riuer of Medwey arriued at Rochester. The Kentishmen assembled togither
and fought with the Danes, but they were ouercome, and so left the field to the Danes.
After this, the same Danes sailed into Normandie, and king Egelred went into Cumberland,
where the Danes inhabited in great numbers, whome he ouercame with sore warre, and wasted
<span class="rightnote">1000.</span>
almost all Cumberland, taking great spoiles in the same. About the same time, or shortlie
<span class="leftnote">1001. <br />Exmouth</span>
after, the Danes with their nauie, returning out of Normandie, came vnto Exmouth, and there
assaulted the castell, but they were repelled by them that kept it. After this they spread
abroad ouer all the countrie, exercising their accustomed trade of destroieng all before them
<span class="rightnote">Pentho.</span>
with fire and sword. The men of Summersetshire fought with them at Pentho, but the Danes
got the vpper hand.</p>
<p>
Thus the state of the realme in those daies was verie miserable, for there wanted worthie
chieftains to rule the people, and to chastise them when they did amisse. There was no trust
in the noble men, for euerie one impugned others dooing, and yet would not deuise which
<span class="rightnote">Disagréement with councellors what fruit it bringeth.</span>
way to deale with better likelihood. When they assembled in councell, and should haue
occupied their heads in deuising remedies for the mischiefe of the common wealth, they turned
their purpose vnto altercation, about such strifes, contentions and quarels as each one
against other, and suffered the generall case to lie still in the dust. And if at anie time there
was anie good conclusion agreed vpon, for the withstanding of the enimie, &amp; reléefe of the
common wealth, anon should the enimie be aduertised thereof by such as were of aliance
or consanguinitie to them. For (as Caxton, Polychr. and others say) the English bloud was
so mixed with that of the Danes and Britains, who were like enimies to the Englishmen, that<a name="page708" id="page708"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;708]</span>
there was almost few of the nobilitie and commons, which had not on the one side a parent of
some of them.</p>
<p>
Whereby it came to passe, that neither the secret purposes of the king could be concealed
till they might take due effect; neither their assemblies proue quiet without quarelling and
taking of parts. Manie also being sent foorth with their powers one way (whilest the king went
to make resistance another) did reuolt to his enimies, and turned their swords against him
(as you haue heard of Elfrike and his complices, and shall read of manie others) so that it
was no maruell that Egelred sped no better, and yet was he as valiant as anie of his predecessors,
although the moonks fauour him not in their writings, because he demanded aid of them
toward his warres, and was nothing fauorable to their lewd hypocrisie. But what is a king
if his subiects be not loiall? What is a realme, if the common wealth be diuided? By peace
&amp; concord, of small beginnings great and famous kingdomes haue oft times procéeded;
whereas by discord the greatest kingdoms haue oftner bene brought to ruine. And so it
proued here, for whilest priuat quarels are pursued, the generall affaires are vtterlie neglected:
and whilest ech nation séeketh to preferre hir owne aliance, the Iland it selfe is like to
become a desert.</p>
<p>
But to procéed with our monasticall writers: certes they lay all the fault in the king, saieng
that he was a man giuen to no good exercise, he delighted in fleshlie lustes and riotous bankettings
and still sought waies how to gather of his subiects what might be got, as well by vnlawfull
meanes as otherwise.
<span class="rightnote">The misgouernement of the king.</span>
For he would for feined or for verie small &amp; light causes disherit
his natiue subiects, and cause them to redéeme their owne possessions for great summes
<span class="leftnote">Sicknesse vexeth the people.</span>
of monie. Besides these oppressions, diuers kinds of sicknesses vexed the people also, as
the bloodie flix, and hot burning agues which then raged through the land, so that manie
died thereof. By such manner of meanes therefore, what through the misgouernance of the
<span class="rightnote">Treason in the nobilitie.</span>
king, the treason and disloialtie of the nobilitie, the lacke of good order and due correction
amongst the people, and by such other scourges and mishaps as afflicted the English nation
in that season, the land was brought into great ruine, so that, where by strength the enimie
could not be kept off, there was now no hope but to appease them with monie. By reason
<span class="righnote">The inhancing of the tribute paid to the Danes.</span>
hereof from time of the first agréement with the Danes for 10 thousand pounds tribute, it was
inhanced to 16000 pounds, (as you haue heard) &amp; after that to 20000 pounds, then to
24000 pounds, &amp; so to 30000 pounds, &amp; lastlie to 40000 pounds, till at length the relme
was emptied in maner of all that monie and coine that could be found in it. In this meane time
<span class="rightnote">The death of quéene Elgina.</span>
died Elgina or Ethelgina the quéene. Shortlie after it was deuised that the king should be a
<span class="leftnote">Emma. <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i></span>
suter vnto Richard duke of Normandie, for his sister Emma, a ladie of such excellent beautie,
that she was named the floure of Normandie. This sute was begun and tooke such good successe,
<span class="rightnote">1002. <br />Emma daughter of R. duke of Normandie maried to K. Edgar.</span>
that the king obteined his purpose. And so in the yeare of our Lord 1002, which was
about the 24 yeare of king Egelreds reigne, he maried the said Emma with great solemnitie.</p>
<p>
This mariage was thought to be right necessarie, honorable, and profitable for the realme
of England, because of the great puissance of the Norman princes in those daies: but as
things afterward came to passe, it turned to the subuersion of the whole English state: for
by such affinitie and dealing as happened hereby betwixt the Normans and Englishmen, occasion
in the end was ministred to the same Normans to pretend a title to the crowne of England,
in prosecuting of which title, they obteined and made the whole conquest of the land, as
after shall appeare. Egelred being greatlie aduanced (as he thought) by reason of his mariage,
deuised vpon presumption thereof, to cause all the Danes within the land to be murthered
in one day. Herevpon he sent priuie commissioners to all cities, burrowes and townes
within his dominions, commanding the rulers and officers in the same, to kill all such Danes
as remained within their liberties, at a certeine day prefixed, being saint Brices day, in the yeare
<span class="rightnote">1012. <br />The 18 of Nouember. <br />The murder of the Danes.</span>
1012, and in the 34 yeare of king Egelreds reigne. Herevpon (as sundrie writers agree) in one
day &amp; houre this murther began, and was according to the commission and iniunction
executed. But where it first began, the same is vncerteine: some say at Wellowin in Herefordshire,
some at a place in Staffordshire called Hownhill, &amp; others in other places, but whersoeuer<a name="page709" id="page709"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;709]</span>
it began, the dooers repented it after.
<span class="leftnote">Hownhill, or Houndhill, a place within Merchington parish beside the forest of Néedwood,
somewhat more than two miles from Vtoxcester.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The miserable state of this realme vnder the thraldome of the Danes.</span>
But now yer we procéed anie further, we will shew what rule the Danes kept here in this
realme before they were thus murthered, as in some bookes we find recorded. Whereas it
is shewed that the Danes compelled the husbandmen to til the ground &amp; doo all maner of labour
and toile to be doone about husbandrie: the Danes liued vpon the fruit and gaines that
came thereof, and kept the husbandmens wiues, their daughters, maids and seruants, vsing and
abusing them at their pleasures. And when the husbandmen came home, then could they
scarse haue such sustenance of meats and drinkes as fell for seruants to haue: so that the
Danes had all their commandements, eating and drinking of the best, where the sillie man
that was the owner, could hardlie come to his fill of the worst. Besides this, the common
people were so oppressed by the Danes, that for feare and dread they called them in
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hector Boet.</i></span>
euerie such house where anie of them soiourned, Lord Dane. And if an Englishman and a
Dane chanced to méet at anie bridge or streight passage, the Englishman must staie till the
Lord Dane were passed. But in processe of time, after the Danes were voided the land, this
word Lord Dane was in derision and despight of the Danes turned by Englishmen into a name
<span class="rightnote">Lordane whereof the word came.</span>
of reproch, as Lordane, which till these our daies is not forgotten. For when the people in
manie parts of this realme will note and signifie anie great idle lubber that will not labour nor
take paine for his liuing, they will call him Lordane. Thus did the Danes vse the Englishmen
in most vile manner, and kept them in such seruile thraldome as cannot be sufficientlie
vttered.</p>

<h3>THE FOURTH CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
Vpon knowledge giuen into Denmarke of the cruell murder of the Danes here in England,
truth it is, that the people of the countrie were greatlie kindled in malice, and set in such
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hen. Hunt.</i> <i>Simon Dun.</i> The Danes returne to inuade England. <br />Excester taken. 1002.</span>
a furious rage against the Englishmen, that with all spéed they made foorth a nauie full
fraught with men of warre, the which in the yeare following came swarming about the coasts
of England, and landing in the west countrie, tooke the citie of Excester, and gat there a rich
<span class="leftnote">Hugh a Norman conspireth with the Danes.</span>
spoile. One Hugh a Norman borne, whome quéene Emma had placed in those parties as
gouernour or shirife there, conspired with the Danes, so that all the countrie was ouerrun and
wasted.</p>
<p>
The king hearing that the Danes were thus landed, and spoiled the west parts of the
realme, he sent vnto Edricus to assemble a power to withstand the enimies. Herevpon the
people of Hampshire and Wiltshire rose and got togither: but when the armies should ioine,
<span class="rightnote">The counterfait sicknesse of duke Edrike. <br />Wilton spoiled.</span>
earle Edricus surnamed de Streona feigned himselfe sicke, and so betraied his people, of<a name="page710" id="page710"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;710]</span>
whome he had the conduct: for they perceiuing the want in their leader, were discouraged,
and so fled. The Danes followed them vnto Wilton, which towne they rifled and ouercame.
From thence they went to Salisburie, and so taking their pleasure there, returned to
<span class="leftnote"><i>Simon Dun.</i> <br />1004.</span>
their ships, because (as some write) they were aduertised that the king was comming towards
them with an huge armie. In the yeare next insuing, that is to saie 1004, which was about
<span class="rightnote">Swein king of Denmarke. <br />Norwich taken by the Danes. <br />Thetford burnt.</span>
the 24 yeare of K. Egelreds reigne, Sweine or Swanus, king of Denmarke, with a mightie nauie
of ships came on the coast of Northfolke, and there landing with his people, made toward
Norwich, and comming thither tooke that citie, and spoiled it. Then went he vnto
Thetford, and when he had taken and rifled that towne, he burnt it, notwithstanding a truce
<span class="leftnote">Vikillus or Wilfeketell gouernour of Norffolke.</span>
taken by Vikillus or Wilfketell gouernor of those parties with the same king Swaine after the
taking of Norwich. In reuenge therefore of such breach of truce, the same Vikillus, or
Wilfeketell, with such power as he could raise, assaulted the host of Danes as they returned to
their ships, and slue a great number of them, but was not able to mainteine the fight, for his
enimies ouermatched him in number of men. And so he was constrained in the end to giue
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hen. Hunt.</i></span>
backe: and the enimies kept on their waies to their ships.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote">1005. Swaine returned into Denmarke. <i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
In the yeare following king Swaine returned into Denmarke with all his fléet, partlie constrained
so to doo (as some write) by reason of the great famin &amp; want of necessarie sustenance,
<span class="rightnote">1006. <i>Hen. Hunt.</i> Swaine returned into England.</span>
which in that yeare sore oppressed this land. In the yeare of our Lord 1006, king Swaine returned
againe into England with a mightie &amp; huge nauie, arriuing at Sandwich, and spoiled all
the countrie néere vnto the sea side. King Egelred raised all his power against him, and all
the haruest time laie abroad in the field to resist the Danes, which according to their woonted
maner spared not to exercise their vnmercifull crueltie, in wasting and spoiling the land with
fire and sword, pilfering and taking of preies in euerie part where they came. Neither could
king Egelred remedie the matter, because the enimies still conueied themselues with their ships
into some contrarie quarter, from the place where they knew him to be, so that his trauell was
in vaine.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The Danes winter in the Ile of Wight. They inuade Hampshire, Barkeshire, &amp;c.</span>
About the beginning of winter they remained in the Ile of Wight, &amp; in the time of Christmasse
they landed in Hampshire, and passing through that countrie into Barkeshire, they came
to Reading, and from thence to Wallingford, and so to Coleseie, and then approching to
Essington, came to Achikelmeslawe, and in euerie place wheresoeuer they came, they made
cleane worke. For that which they could not carie with them, they consumed with fire,
burning vp their innes and sleaing their hoasts. In returning backe, the people of the west
countrie gaue them battell, but preuailed not, so that they did but inrich their enimies with
<span class="rightnote">Winchester.</span>
the spoile of their bodies. They came by the gates of Winchester as it were in maner of
triumph, with vittels and spoiles which they had fetched fiftie miles from the sea side. In the
<span class="leftnote">1007.</span>
meane time king Egelred lay about Shrewsburie sore troubled with the newes hereof, and in
the yeare next insuing, by the aduise of his councell he gaue to king Swaine for the redeeming
<span class="rightnote">36000 pound saith <i>Si. Dun.</i></span>
of peace 30000 pounds.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Edrike de Streona made duke or earle of Mercia.</span>
In the same yeare K. Egelred created the traitor Edrike earle of Mercia, who although he
had maried Edgiua the kings daughter, was yet noted to be one of those which disclosed the
secrets of the realme, and the determinations of the councell vnto the enimies. But he was
such a craftie dissembler, so greatlie prouided of sleight to dissemble and cloake his falshood,
that the king being too much abused by him, had him in singular fauour, whereas he vpon
a malicious purpose studied dailie how to bring the realme into vtter destruction, aduertising
the enimies from time to time how the state of things stood, whereby they came to knowlege
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malm.</i></span>
when they should giue place, and when they might safelie come forward. Moreouer, being
sent vnto them oftentimes as a commissioner to treat for peace, he persuaded them to warre.
But such was the pleasure of God, to haue him and such other of like sort aduanced to honor
in this season, when by his diuine prouidence he meant to punish the people of this realme for
their wickednesse and sinnes, whereby they had iustlie prouoked his wrath and high displeasure.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Henr. Hunt. Simon Dun.</i> <br />An hundred acres is an hide of land. <br />1008</span>
In the 30 yeare of king Egelreds reigne, which fell in the yeare of our Lord 1008, he tooke<a name="page711" id="page711"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;711]</span>
order that of euerie thrée hundred and ten hides of land within this realme, there should one
ship be builded, and of euerie eight hides a complet armor furnished. In the yeare following,
the kings whole fléet was brought togither at Sandwich, and such souldiers came thither as
were appointed to go to sea in the same fléet. There had not béene séene the like number

desirous to win honor, tooke forth foure score of the said ships, and promised to bring in the

wind rose with such violence, that his ships were cast vpon the shore: and Wilnot
comming vpon them, set them on fire, and so burned them euerie one. The residue of the
ships, when newes came to them of this mishap, returned backe to London; and then was
the armie dispersed, and so all the cost and trauell of the Englishmen proued in vaine.</p>

After this, in the haruest time a new armie of Danes, vnder the conduct of thrée capteines,
Turkill, Henning, and Aulafe landed at Sandwich, and from thence passed forth to Canturburie,
and had taken the citie but that the citizens gaue them a 1000 pounds to depart from thence,

onelie to put him in feare) had not dissuaded him from giuing battell. The Danes by that

After the feast of Christmasse they passed through the countrie and woods of Chilterne

giue them battell; that part of their host which kept on the northside of the riuer, passed the
<span class="leftnote">Stanes.</span>
same riuer at Stanes, and so ioining with their fellowes marched foorth through Southerie,
and comming backe to their ships in Kent, fell in hand to repare &amp; amend their ships that

fame and commendation. There was no mindfulnesse amongest them of running
awaie, so that a great number of the nobilitie and other were beaten downe and slaine, till at

flight, and deserued thereby an euerlasting reproch.</p>
<p>
The Danes obteining the vpper hand, for the space of thrée moneths togither went vp and
downe the countries, &amp; wasted those parties of the realme, that is to say, Northfolke, and
Suffolke, with the borders of Lincolnshire, Huntingtonshire, and Cambridgeshire where the fens
are, gaining excéeding riches by the spoile of great and wealthie abbies and churches which
<span class="rightnote">Thetford. Cambridge. <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i></span>

burnt Cambridge, and from thence passed through the pleasant mountaine-countrie of Belsham,
cruellie murdering the people without respect of age, degrée or sex. After this also

they entred into Essex. and so came backe to their ships, which were then arriued in the

destruction of this realme. So as soone after, when they had somwhat refreshed them,
they set forward againe into the countrie, passing through Buckinghamshire, &amp; so into Bedfordshire.

was doone in the countries that lie on the northside of the riuer of Thames. On the southside

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The king sendeth to the Danes. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
The king and the peeres of the realme, vnderstanding of the Danes dealing in such merciles
maner (as is aboue mentioned) but not knowing how to redresse the matter, sent ambassadors
vnto the Danes, offering them great summes of moneie to leaue off such cruell
wasting and spoiling of the land. The Danes were contented to reteine the moneie, but yet
could not absteine from their cruell dooings, neither was their greedie thirst of bloud and
spoile satisfied with the wasting and destroieng of so manie countries and places as they had
<span class="rightnote">1011. <br />Canturburie wonne by Danes.</span>
passed through. Wherevpon, in the yeere of our Lord 1011, about the feast of S. Matthew
in September, they laid siege to the citie of Canturburie, which of the citizens was valiantlie
defended by the space of twentie daies. In the end of which terme it was taken by the

enimies, through the treason of a deacon named Almaricus, whome the archbishop Elphegus
had before that time preserued from death. The Danes exercised passing great crueltie
in the winning of that citie (as by sundrie authors it dooth and maie appéere.) For they
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian ex Antonino.</i></span>
slue of men, women, and children, aboue the number of eight thousand. They tooke the
<span class="leftnote">The archbishop Elphegus taken. <i>Hen. Hunt.</i></span>
archbishop Elphegus with an other bishop named Godwine; also abbat Lefwin and Alseword
the kings bailife there. They spared no degrée, in somuch that they slue and tooke 900
priests, and other men of religion. And when they had taken their pleasure of the citie, they
<span class="rightnote"><i>Antoninus. Vincentius</i>. <br /><i>Wil. Lamb. <br />ex Asserio Meneuensi, &amp; alijs.</i></span>
set it on fire, and so returned to their ships. There be some which write that they tithed the
people after an inuerted order, slaieng all by nines through the whole multitude, and reserued
the tenth: so that of all the moonks there were but foure saued, and of the laie people 4800,
whereby it followeth that there died 43200 persons. Whereby is gathered that the citie of
Canturburie, and the countrie thereabouts (the people whereof belike fled thither for succor)
was at that time verie well inhabited, so as there haue not wanted (saith maister Lambert)
which affirme that it had then more people than London it selfe.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">1112. <br /><i>Henr. Hunt.</i></span>
But now to our purpose. In the yéere next insuing, vpon the Saturday in Easter wéeke,
after that the bishop Elphegus had béene kept prisoner with them the space of six or seuen
moneths, they cruellie in a rage led him foorth into the fields, and dashed out his braines with
<span class="leftnote">The archbishop Elphegus murthered.</span>
stones, bicause he would not redéeme his libertie with thrée thousand pounds, which they demanded
to haue beene leuied of his farmers and tenants. This cruell murther was commited
at Gréenewich foure miles distant from London, the 19 of Aprill, where he lay a certeine
<span class="rightnote">Miracles.</span>
time vnburied, but at length through miracles shewed (as they say, for miracles are all
<span class="rightnote">Elphegus buried in London.</span>
wrought now by dead men, and not by the liuing) the Danes permitted that his bodie<a name="page713" id="page713"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;713]</span>
might be caried to London, and there was it buried in the church of S. Paule, where it rested
for the space of ten yeeres, till king Cnute or Knought had the gouernment of this land, by
<span class="rightnote">Translated to Canturburie.</span>
whose appointment it was remooued to Canturburie.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote"><i>Wil. Malms.</i> Turkillus held Norffolk and Suffolke.</span>
Turkillus the leader of those Danes by whome the archbishop Elphegus was thus murthered,
held Northfolke and Suffolke vnder his subiection, &amp; so continued in those parties as
chiefe lord and gouernor. But the residue of the Danes at length, compounding with the
<span class="rightnote">48 thousand pound as saith <br /><i>Sim. Dun.</i> and <br /><i>M. West.</i> <br /><i>Henr. Hunt.</i></span>
Englishmen for a tribute to be paid to them of eight thousand pounds, spred abroad in the
countrie, soiorning in cities, townes and villages, where they might find most conuenient harbour.
Moreouer, fortie of their ships, or rather (as some write) 45 were reteined to serue the
king, promising to defend the realme; with condition, that the souldiers and mariners should
haue prouision of meate and drinke, with apparell found them at the kings charges. As
one autor hath gathered, Swaine king of Denmarke was in England at the concluding of
this peace, which being confirmed with solemne othes and sufficient hostages, he departed into
Denmarke.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth. West.</i></span>
The same author bringeth the generall slaughter of Danes vpon S. Brices day, to haue
chanced in the yéere after the conclusion of this agreement, that is to say, in the yeere 1012,
<span class="leftnote">Gunthildis the sister of K. Swaine murthered.</span>
at what time Gunthildis the sister of king Swaine was slaine, with hir husband &amp; hir sonne, by
the commandement of the false traitor Edrike. But bicause all other authors agree that the
murther of Danes was executed about ten yeeres before this supposed time: we haue
made rehearsall thereof in that place. Howbeit, for the death of Gunthildis, it maie be, that she
became hostage either in the yéere 1007, at what time king Egelred paied thirtie thousand
pounds vnto king Swaine to haue peace (as before you haue heard) or else might she be deliuered
in hostage, in the yéere 1011, when the last agréement was made with the Danes (as
aboue is mentioned.) But when or at what time soeuer she became hostage, this we find of
hir, that she came hither into England with hir husband Palingus, a mightie earle, and receiued
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malm.</i></span>
baptisme héere. Wherevpon she earnestlie trauelled in treatie of a peace betwixt hir brother
and king Egelred: which being brought to passe chieflie by hir sute, she was contented to
become an hostage for performance thereof (as before is recited.) And after by the commandement
of earle Edrike she was put to death, pronouncing that the shedding of hir
bloud would cause all England one day sore to rue. She was a verie beautifull ladie, and tooke
hir death without all feare, not once changing countenance, though she saw hir husband and
hir onelie sonne (a yoong gentleman of much towardnesse) first murthered before hir face.</p>

<h3>THE SIXT CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Turkillus discloseth the secrets of the Realme to K. Swaine. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
Now had Turkillus in the meanetime aduertised king Swaine in what state things stood
here within the realme: how king Egelred was negligent, onlie attending to the lusts &amp;
pleasures of the flesh: how the noble men were vnfaithfull, and the commons weake and<a name="page714" id="page714"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;714]</span>
feeble through want of good and trustie leaders.  Howbeit, some write, that Turkillus as
well as other of the Danes which remained héere in England, was in league with king Egelred,
in somuch that he was with him in London, to helpe and defend the citie against Swaine
when he came to assalt it (as after shall appéere.) Which if it be true, a doubt may rise whether
Swaine receiued anie aduertisement from Turkillus to mooue him the rather to inuade
the realme: but such aduertisements might come from him before that he was accorded with
Egelred.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Swaine prepareth an armie to inuade England. </span>
Swaine therefore as a valiant prince, desirous both to reuenge his sisters death, and win
honor, prepared an huge armie, and a great number of ships, with the which he made towards

England, and first comming to Sandwich, taried there a small while, and taking eftsoones the
sea, compassed about the coasts of Eastangles, and arriuing in the mouth of Humber, sailed
vp the water, and entering into the riuer of Trent, he landed at Gainesbourgh, purposing to
inuade the Northumbers. But as men brought into great feare, for that they had béene subiect
to the Danes in times past, and thinking therefore not to reuolt to the enimie, but rather
<span class="rightnote">The Northumbers yéeld to Swaine.
The people of Lindsey yéeld themselues to him. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
to their old acquaintance, if they should submit themselues to the Danes, streightwaies offered
to become subiect vnto Swaine, togither with their duke named Wighthred. Also the people

of Lindsey and all those of the northside of Watlingstréet yéelded themselues vnto him, and
delivered pledges. Then he appointed his sonne Cnutus to haue the kéeping of those pledges,

and to remaine vpon the safegard of his ships, whiles he himselfe passed forward into the
<span class="leftnote">South Mercia.</span>
countrie. Then marched he forward to subdue them of south Mercia: and so came to
Oxford &amp; to Winchester, making the countries subiect to him throughout wheresoeuer he
came.</p>
<p>
With this prosperous successe Swaine being greatlie incouraged, prepared to go vnto
London, where king Egelred as then remained, hauing with him Turkillus the Dane, which
<span class="rightnote"><i>Sim. Dunel.</i> </span>
was reteined in wages with other of the Danes (as by report of some authors it maie appeare)
and were now readie to defend the citie against their countriemen in support of king
Egelred, togither with the citizens. Swaine, bicause he would not step so farre out of the
way as to go to the next bridge, lost a great number of his men as he passed through the
<span class="rightnote">Swaine assaulteth London.</span>
Thames. At his comming to London, he began to assault the citie verie fiercelie, in hope
either to put his enimie in such feare that he should despaire of all reliefe and comfort, or at
the least trie what he was able to doo. The Londoners on the other part, although they were
brought in some feare by this sudden attempt of the enimies, yet considering with themselues,
that the hazard of all the whole state of the realme was annexed to theirs, sith their citie was
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
the chiefe and metropolitane of all the kingdome, they valiantlie stood in defense of themselues,
and of their king that was present there with them, beating backe the enimies, chasing
them from the walles, and otherwise dooing their best to kéepe them off. At length, although
the Danes did most valiantlie assault the citie, yet the Englishmen to defend their
prince from all iniurie of enimies, did not shrinke, but boldlie sallied foorth at the gates in
heapes togither, and incountered with their aduersaries, and began to fight with them verie
fiercelie.</p>
<p>
Swaine whilest he went about to kéepe his men in order, as one most desirous to reteine
the victorie now almost gotten, was compassed so about with the Londoners on each side,
that after he had lost a great number of his men, he was constreined for his safegard to
breake out through the midst of his enimies weapons, and was glad that he might so escape:
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malm.</i> <br />Erle of Deuonshire as saith <br /><i>Matt. West.</i> <br />
<i>Polydor.</i> </span>
and so with the residue of his armie ceassed not to iournie day and night till he came to Bath,
where Ethelmere an earle of great power in those west parts of the realme submitted himselfe
with all his people vnto him, who shortlie after neuerthelesse (as some write) was compelled
through want of vittels to release the tribute latelie couenanted to be paied vnto him for a
<span class="leftnote">Swaine returneth into Denmarke.</span>
certeine summe of monie, which when hée had receiued, he returned into Denmarke, meaning
shortlie to returne againe with a greater power.</p>
<p>
King Egelred supposed that by the paiment of that monie he should haue béene rid out<a name="page715" id="page715"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;715]</span>
of all troubles, of warre with the Danes. But the nobles of the realme thought otherwise,
<span class="rightnote">Swaine returneth into England to make warre.</span>
and therefore willed him to prepare an armie with all speéd that might be made. Swaine
taried not long (to proue the doubt of the noble men to be grounded of foreknowledge)
but that with swift spéed he returned againe into England, and immediatlie vpon his arriuall
was an armie of Englishmen assembled and led against him into the field. Herevpon they
<span class="rightnote">King Egelred discomfited in battell.</span>
ioined in battell, which was sore foughten for a time, till at length by reason of diuerse
Englishmen that turned to the enimies side, the discomfiture fell with such slaughter vpon
the English host, that king Egelred well perceiued the state of his regall gouernement to bée
brought into vtter danger. Wherevpon after the losse of this field, he assembled the rest
of his people that were escaped, and spake vnto them after this manner.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The oration of king Egelred to the remanent of his souldiers.</i></p>
<p>
"I shuld for euer be put to silence, if there wanted in vs the vertue of a fatherlie
mind, in giuing good aduise &amp; counsel for the well ordering and due administration of things
in the common wealth, or if there lacked courage or might in our souldiers and men of
warre to defend our countrie. Trulie to die in defense of the countrie where we are borne,
I confesse it a woorthie thing, and I for my part am readie to take vpon me to enter into the
midst of the enimies in defense of my kingdome. But here I see our countrie and the
whole English nation to be at a point to fall into vtter ruine. We are ouercome of the
Danes, not with weapon or force of armes; but with treason wrought by our owne people:
we did at the first prepare a nauie against the enimies, the which that false traitour Elfrike
betraid into their hands. Againe, oftentimes haue we giuen battell with euill successe,
and onelie through the fault of our owne people that haue beene false and disloiall: whereby
we haue bin constreined to agree with the enimies vpon dishonorable conditions, euen as
necessitie required, which to ouercome, resteth onelie in God. Such kind of agreement hath
beene made in deed to our destruction, sith the enimies haue not sticked to breake it (they
being such a wicked kind of people as neither regard God nor man) contrarie to right and
reason, and beside all our hope &amp; expectation. So that the matter is come now to this
passe, that we haue not cause onlie to feare the losse of our gouernement, but least the
name of the whole English nation be destroied for euer. Therefore sithens the enimies are
at hand, and as it were ouer our heads, you to whom my commandement hath euer bene
had in good regard, prouide, take counsell, and see to succor the state of your countrie now
readie to decay and to fall into irrecouerable ruine."</p>
<p>
Herevpon they fell in consultation, euerie one alledging and bringing foorth his opinion
as seemed to him best: but it appeared they had the woolfe by the eare, for they wist not
which way to turne them. If they should giue battell, it was to be doubted least through
treason among themselues, the armie should be betraied into the enimies hands, the which
would not faile to execute all kind of crueltie in the slaughter of the whole nation. And if
they stood not valiantlie to shew themselues readie to defend their countrie, there was no
shift but yeeld themselues. Which though it were a thing reprochfull and dishonorable, yet
should it be lesse euill, as they tooke the matter, for thereby might manie be preserued
from death, and in time to come, be able to recouer the libertie of their countrie, when
occasion should be offered. This point was allowed of them all, and so in the end they
rested vpon that resolution.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">King Egelred determineth to give place vnto Swaine. <br />

King Egelred therefore determined to commit himselfe into the hands of his brother in

he would not doo this vnaduisedlie, first he sent ouer his wife quéene Emma, with his

Swaine hauing now got the whole rule of the land, was reputed full king, and so
commanded that his armie should be prouided of wages and vittels to be taken vp &amp; leuied
through the realme. In like maner Turkill commanded that to his armie lodged at Gréenewich,
wages and vittels sufficient should be deliuered, for the finding, releeuing, succouring,
<span class="rightnote">Swaine handleth the Englishmen hardlie.</span>
and susteining thereof. Swaine vsed the victorie verie cruellie against the Englishmen, oppressing
them on each hand; to the intent that them being brought low he might gouerne
in more suertie. The yéere in which he obteined the rule thus of this realme, and that king
Egelred was constreined to flie into Normandie, was in the 35 yeere of the same Egelred
his reigne, and after the birth of our Lord 1014. Swaine being once established in the
gouernment, did not onelie vse much crueltie in oppressing the laitie, but also stretched
foorth his hand to the church, and to the ministers in the same, fléecing them and spoiling
both churches and ministers, without anie remorse of conscience, insomuch that hauing a
quarell against the inhabitants within the precinct of S. Edmunds land in Suffolke, he did
not onelie harrie the countrie, but also rifled and spoiled the abbeie of Burie, where the

<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i> <br />S. Edmund fighteth for the wealth, but not for the slaughter of
his people. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i> <br />1015.</span>
Wherevpon shortlie after, as he was at Gainesbrough or Thetford (as some say) and there
in his iollitie talked with his Nobles of his good successe in conquering of this land, he
was suddenlie striken with a knife, as it is reported, miraculouslie, for no man wist how or
by whome: and within thrée daies after, to wit, on the third of Februarie he ended his
life with grieuous paine and torment in yelling and roring, by reason of his extreame anguish
beyond all measure. There hath sproong a pleasant tale among the posteritie of that
age, how he should be wounded with the same knife which king Edmund in his life time
<span class="leftnote"><i>Albertus Crantz.</i> <i>Saxo Grammaticus.</i></span>
vsed to weare. Thus haue some of our writers reported, but the Danish chronicles report
a farre more happie end which should chance to this Swaine, than is before mentioned out
of our writers: for the said chronicles report, that after he had subdued England, he tooke
order with king Egelred, whome they name amisse Adelstane, that he should not ordeine<a name="page717" id="page717"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;717]</span>
any other successor, but onlie the said Swaine. Then after this, he returned into Denmarke,
where vsing himselfe like a right godlie prince, at length he there ended his life, being a verie
old man.</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding all this, when or howsoeuer he died, immediatlie after his deceasse the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malmes. <br />H. Hunt.</i> <br />Canute or Cnute.</span>
Danes elected his sonne Cnute or Knought to succeed in his dominions. But the Englishmen
of nothing more desirous than to shake off the yoke of Danish thraldome besides their
necks &amp; shoulders, streightwaies vpon knowledge had of Swaines death, with all spéed aduertised
<span class="rightnote">Eglered sent for home.</span>
king Egelred thereof, and that they were readie to receiue and assist him if he
would make hast to come ouer to deliuer his countrie out of the hands of strangers. These
newes were right ioiful vnto Egelred, who burning in desire to be reuenged on them that
had expelled him out of his kingdome, made no longer tariance to set that enterprise forward.
<span class="rightnote">Edmund K. Egelreds eldest sonne.</span>
But yet doubting the inconstancie of the people, he sent his elder son (named Edmund) to
trie the minds of them, and to vnderstand whether they were constant or wauering in that
which they had promised.</p>
<p>
The yoong gentleman hasting ouer into England, and with diligent inquirie perceiuing
how they were bent, returned with like spéed as he came into Normandie againe, declaring
to his father, that all things were in safetie if he would make hast. King Egelred then conceiued
<span class="rightnote">King Egelred returneth into England.</span>
an assured hope to recouer his kingdom, aided with his brother in laws power, and
trusting vpon the assistance of the Englishmen, returned into England in the time of Lent.
His returne was ioifull and most acceptable to the English people, as to those that abhorred
<span class="leftnote">Canutes endeuor to establish himselfe in the kingdome.</span>
the rule of the Danes, which was most sharpe and bitter to them, although Cnute did
what he could by bountifulnesse and courteous dealings to haue reteined them vnder his
obeisance.</p>
<p>
And of an intent to procure Gods fauour in the well ordering of things for the administration
in the common wealth, he sought first to appease his wrath, and also to make amends
to saint Edmund for his fathers offense committed (as was thought) against him: insomuch
<span class="rightnote">S. Edmunds ditch.</span>
that after he had obteined the kingdome, he caused a great ditch to be cast round about the
land of saint Edmund, and granted manie fréedoms to the inhabitants, acquiting them of
certeine taskes and paiments, vnto the which other of their neighbours were contributarie.
He also builded a church on the place where saint Edmund was buried, and ordeined an
house of moonks there, or rather remooued the canons or secular priests that were there
afore, and put moonks in their roomes.  He offered vp also his crowne vnto the same
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor. <br />Fabian.</i></span>
S. Edmund, and redéemed it againe with a great summe of monie, which maner of dooing
grew into an vse vnto other kings that followed him. He adorned the church there with
manie rich iewels, and indowed the monasterie with great possessions.</p>
<p>
But these things were not done now at the first, but after that he was established in the
kingdome. For in the meane time, after that king Egelred was returned out of Normandie,
Cnute as then soiourning at Gainesbrough, remained there till the feast of Easter, and made
agréement with them of Lindsey, so that finding him horsses, they should altogither go
foorth to spoile their neighbors. King Egelred aduertised thereof, sped him thither with a
mightie host, and with great crueltie burned vp the countrie, and slue the more part of the
<span class="rightnote">Canute driven to forsake the land.</span>
inhabitants, bicause they had taken part with his enimies. Cnute as then was not of power
able to resist Egelred, and therefore taking his ships which lay in Humber, fled from thence,
<span class="leftnote">He was driuen thither by force of contrarie winds as should appeare by <br /><i>Matth. West.</i></span>
&amp; sailed about the coast, till he came to Sandwich, and there sore gréeued in his mind to
remember what mischéefe was fallen and chanced to his friends and subiects of Lindsey,
onelie for his cause; he commanded that such pledges as had béene deliuered to his father
by certeine noble men of this realme, for assurance of their fidelities, should haue their noses
slit, and their eares stuffed, or (as some write) their hands and noses cut off.
<span class="rightnote">The cruell decrée of Cnute against the English pledges. <br />
<i>Will. Malmes.</i> <br />This Turkill was reteined in seruice with Egelred, as I thinke.</span></p>
<p>
When this cruell act according to his commandement was doone, taking the sea, he sailed
into Denmarke: but yet tooke not all the Danes with him which his father brought
thither. For earle Turkill perceiuing the wealthinesse of the land, compounded with the
Englishmen, and chose rather to remaine in a region replenished with all riches, than to<a name="page718" id="page718"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;718]</span>
returne home into his owne countrie that wanted such commodities as were here to be had.
And yet (as some thought) he did not forsake his souereigne lord Cnute for anie euill
meaning towards him, but rather to aid him (when time serued) to recouer the possession
of England againe, as it afterwards well appeared. For notwithstanding that he was now
reteined by K. Egelred with fortie ships, and the flower of all the Danes that were men of
warre, so that Cnute returned but with 60 ships into his countrie: yet shortlie after, erle
Turkill with 9 of those ships sailed into Denmarke, submitted himselfe vnto Cnute, counselled
him to returne into England, and promised him the assistance of the residue of those
<span class="rightnote"><i>Encomium Emmæ.</i></span>
Danish ships which yet remained in England, being to the number of thirtie, with all
the souldiers and mariners that to them belonged. To conclude, he did so much by his
earnest persuasions, that Cnute (through aid of his brother Harrold king of Denmarke)
got togither a nauie of two hundred ships, so roially decked, furnished, and appointed,
both for braue shew and necessarie furniture of all maner of weapons, armor &amp; munition,
as it is strange to consider that which is written by them that liued in those daies, and tooke
in hand to register the dooings of that time. Howbeit to let this pompe of Cnutes fléete
passe, which (no doubt) was right roiall, consider a little and looke backe to Turkill, though
a sworne seruant to king Egelred, how he did direct all his drift
to the aduancement of
Cnute, and his owne commoditie, cloking his purposed treacherie with pretended amitie, as
shall appeare hereafter by his deadlie hostilitie.</p>

<h3>THE EIGHT CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
But now to returne to our purpose, and to shew what chanced in England after the
<span class="rightnote">1015. <br /><i>Matt. West.</i> <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i> <br /><i>Wil. Malm.</i></span>
departure of Cnute. In the same yeare to the forsaid accustomed mischiefes an vnwoonted
misaduenture happened: for the sea rose with such high spring-tides, that ouerflowing the
countries next adioining, diuers villages with the inhabitants were drowned and destroied.
<span class="leftnote"><i>Matt. West.</i></span>
Also to increase the peoples miserie, king Egelred commanded, that 30000 pounds should be
leuied to paie the tribute due to the Danes which lay at Gréenewich. This yeare also king
<span class="rightnote"> A councell at Oxford. Sigeferd and Morcad murdered.</span>
Egelred held a councell at Oxford, at the which a great number of noble men were present,
both Danes and Englishmen, and there did the king cause Sigeferd and Morcad two noble
personages of the Danes to be murdered within his owne chamber, by the traitorous practise
of Edrike de Streona, which accused them of some conspiracie. But the quarell was
onelie as men supposed, for that the king had a desire to their goods and possessions.</p>
<p>Their seruants tooke in hand to haue reuenged the death of their maisters, but were<a name="page719" id="page719"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;719]</span>
beaten backe, wherevpon they fled into the steeple of saint Friswids church, and kept the
same, till fire was set vpon the place, and so they were burned to death. The wife of
Sigeferd was taken, &amp; sent to Malmsburie, being a woman of high fame and great worthinesse,
wherevpon the kings eldest sonne named Edmund, tooke occasion vpon pretense of
other businesse to go thither, and there to sée hir, with whome he fell so far in loue, that
<span class="rightnote">Edmund the kings eldest sonne marrieth the widow of Sigeferd.</span>
he tooke and maried hir. That doone, he required to haue hir husbands lands and possessions,
which were an earles liuing, and lay in Northumberland. And when the king
refused to graunt his request, he went thither, and seized the same possessions and lands
into his hands, without hauing anie commission so to doo, finding the farmers and tenants
there readie to receiue him for their lord.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Cnute returneth into England.</span>
Whilest these things were a dooing, Cnute hauing made his prouision of ships and men,
with all necessarie furniture (as before ye haue heard) for his returne into England, set
forward with full purpose, either to recouer the realme out of Egelreds hands, or to die in
<span class="leftnote"><i>Encomium Emmæ</i>.</span>
the quarrell. Herevpon he landed at Sandwich, and first earle Turkill obteined licence to
go against the Englishmen that were assembled to resist the Danes, and finding them at a
place called Scorastan, he gaue them the ouerthrow, got a great bootie, and returned therewith
to the ships. After this, Edrike gouernor of Norwaie made a rode likewise into an
other part of the countrie, &amp; with a rich spoile, and manie prisoners, returned vnto the nauie.
After this iournie atchiued thus by Edrike, Cnute commanded that they should not waste the
countrie anie more, but gaue order to prepare all things readie to besiege London: but before
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malm</i>. <br /><i>Hen. Hunt</i>. <br /><i>Matth. West</i>. <br /><i>Sim. Dun</i>.</span>
he attempted that enterprise, as others write, he marched foorth into Kent, or rather
sailing round about that countrie, tooke his iournie westward, &amp; came to Fromundham, and
after departing from thence, wasted Dorsetshire, Summersetshire, &amp; Wiltshire.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">King Egelred sicke. <br /><i>Matth. West.</i></span>
King Egelred in this meane time lay sicke at Cossam; and his sonne Edmund had got
togither a mightie hoast, howbeit yer he came to ioine battell with his enimies, he was
aduertised, that earle Edrike went about to betraie him, and therefore he withdrew with

The west countrie <br />The people of Mercia would not yéeld. <br /><i>Matth. West</i>. <br />

the armie into a place of suertie. But Edrike to make his tratorous purpose manifest to the
whole world, fled to the enimies with fortie of the kings ships, fraught with Danish souldiers.
Herevpon, all the west countrie submitted it selfe vnto Cnute, who receiued pledges of the
chiefe lords and nobles, and then set forward to subdue them of Mercia. The people of
that countrie would not yéeld, but determined to defend the quarrell and title of king
Egelred, so long as they might haue anie capteine that would stand with them, and helpe
to order them. In the yeare 1016, in Christmas, Cnute and earle Edrike passed the Thames
at Kirkelade, &amp; entring into Mercia, cruellie began with fire and sword to waste and destroie
<span class="rightnote">Warwikeshire wasted by the Danes. <br />King Egelred recovered of his sicknesse. He assembleth an armie in vaine.</span>
the countrie, and namelie Warwikeshire.</p>
<p>

In the meane time was king Egelred recouered of his sicknesse, and sent summons foorth
to raise all his power, appointing euerie man to resort vnto him, that he might incounter
the enimies and giue them battell. But yet when his people were assembled, he was warned
to take héed vnto himselfe, and in anie wise to beware how he gaue battell, for his owne
subiects were purposed to betraie him. Herevpon the armie brake vp, &amp; king Egelred
withdrew to London, there to abide his enimies within the walles, with whom in the field
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malm.</i> <br />Edmund king Egelreds sonne.</span>
he doubted to trie the battell. His sonne Edmund got him to Vtred, an earle of great
power, inhabiting beyond Humber, and persuading him to ioine his forces with his, forth
they went to waste those countries that were become subiect to Cnute, as Staffordshire,
Leicestershire, and Shropshire, not sparing to exercise great crueltie vpon the inhabitants, as
a punishment for their reuolting, that others might take example thereby.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Cnute, what countries he passed through.</span>
But Cnute perceiuing whereabout they went, politikelie deuised to frustrate their purpose,
and with dooing of like hurt in all places where he came, passed through Buckinghamshire,
Bedfordshire, Huntingtonshire, and so through the fens came to Stamford, and then entred
into Lincolnshire, and from thence into Notinghamshire, &amp; so into Yorkeshire, not sparing
to doo what mischiefe might be deuised in all places where he came. Vtred aduertised
hereof, was constreined to depart home to saue his owne countrie from present destruction,<a name="page720" id="page720"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;720]</span>
and therefore comming backe into Northumberland, &amp; perceiuing himselfe not able to resist
<span class="rightnote">Earle Vtred deliuered pledges to Cnute. <br /><i>Aliùs</i> Egricus.</span>
the puissant force of his enimies, was constreined to deliuer pledges, and submit himselfe
vnto Cnute. But yet was he not hereby warranted from danger, for shortlie after he was
taken, and put to death, and then were his lands giuen vnto one Iricke or Iricius, whome
afterward Cnute did banish out of the realme, because that he did attempt to chalenge
like authoritie to him in all points as Cnute himselfe had. After that Cnute had subdued
the Northumbers, he pursued Edmund, till he heard that he had taken London for
<span class="rightnote">Cnute prepareth to besiege London.</span>
his refuge, and staied there with his father. Then did Cnute take his ships, and came about
to the coasts of Kent, preparing to besiege the citie of London.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">King Egelred departed this life. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i> <br /><i>Matth. West.</i></span>
In the meane time, king Egelred sore worne with long sicknesse, departed this life on the
23 of Aprill, being saint Georges day, or (as others say) on saint Gregories day, being the
12 of March, but I take this to be an error growen, by mistaking the feast-day of saint
<span class="leftnote">He is buried in the church of S. Paul at London.</span>
Gregorie for saint George. He reigned the tearme of 37 yeares, or little lesse. His bodie
was buried in the church of saint Pauls, in the north Ile besids the quéere, as by a memoriall
there on the wall it maie appeare. He had two wiues (as before is mentioned.) By Elgina
his first wife he had issue thrée sonnes, Edmund, Edwine, and Adelstane; besides one
daughter named Egiua. By his second wife Emma, daughter to Richard the first of that
name, duke of Normandie, and sister to Richard the second, he had two sonnes, Alfrid and
Edward.</p>
<p>
This Egelred (as you haue heard) had euill successe in his warres against the Danes, and
besides the calamitie that fell thereby to his people, manie other miseries oppressed this land
in his daies, not so much through his lacke of courage and slouthfull negligence, as by
reason of his presumptuous pride, whereby he alienated the hearts of his people from him.
<span class="rightnote"> The pride of king Egelred alienated the harts of his people.</span>
His affections he could not rule, but was led by them without order of reason, for he did
not onlie disherit diuerse of his owne English subiects without apparant cause of offense by
plaine forged cauillations; and also caused all the Danes to be murdered through his realme
in one day, by some light suspicion of their euill meanings: but also gaue himselfe to
lecherous lusts, in abusing his bodie with naughtie strumpets, forsaking the bed of his owne
lawfull wife, to the great infamie &amp; shame of that high degrée of maiestie, which by his
kinglie office he bare and susteined. To conclude, he was from his tender youth more apt
to idle rest, than to the exercise of warres; more giuen to pleasures of the bodie, than to
anie vertues of the mind: although that toward his latter end, being growen into age, and
taught by long experience of worldlie affaires, and proofe of passed miseries, he sought
(though in vaine) to haue recouered the decaied state of his common wealth and countrie.</p>
<p>
¶ In this Egelreds time, and (as it is recorded by a British chronographer) in the yéere
of our Lord 984, one Cadwalhon, the second sonne of Ieuaf tooke in hand the gouernance
of Northwales, and first made warre with Ionauall his coosen, the sonne of Meyric, and
right heire to the land, and slue him, but Edwall the yoongest brother escaped awaie priuilie.
The yéere following, Meredith the sonne of Owen king or prince of Southwales, with all his
power entered into Northwales, and in fight slue Cadwalhon the sonne of Ieuaf, and Meyric
his brother, and conquered the land to himselfe. Wherein a man maie sée how God
<span class="rightnote">Sée the historie of Cambria pag. 62, 63.</span>
punished the wrong, which Iago and Ieuaf the sonnes of Edwall Voell did to their eldest
brother Meyric, who was first disherited, and afterward his eies put out, and one of his
sonnes slaine. For first Ieuaf was imprisoned by Iago; then Iago with his sonne Constantine,
by Howell the son of Ieuaf: and afterward the said Howell, with his brethren Cadwalhon
and Meyric, were slaine and spoiled of all their lands.</p>

<h3>THE NINTH CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">EDMUND IRONSIDE.</span>
After that king Egelred was dead, his eldest sonne Edmund surnamed Ironside was
proclaimed king by the Londoners and others, hauing the assistance of some lords of the
realme, although the more part, and speciallie those of the
<span class="rightnote">The kingdom goeth where the spiritualtie fauoreth.</span>
spiritualtie fauoured Cnute, bicause
they had aforetime sworne fealtie to his father. Some write, that Cnute had planted
his siege both by water and land verie stronglie about the citie of London, before Egelred
departed this life, and immediatlie vpon his deceasse was receiued into the citie; but the armie
that was within the citie, not consenting vnto the surrender made by the citizens, departed the
night before the day on the which Cnute by appointment should enter, and in companie of
Edmund Ironside (whome they had chosen to be their king and gouernour) they prepared to
increase their numbers with new supplies, meaning eftsoones to trie the fortune of battell
<span class="rightnote">The author of the booke intitled <br /><i>Encomium Emmæ</i> saith that it was reported
that Edmund offered the combate unto Cnute at this his going from the citie but Cnute refused it.</span>
against the Danish power. Cnute perceiuing the most part of all the realme to be thus
against him, and hauing no great confidence in the loialtie of the Londoners, tooke order to
leauie monie for the paiment of his men of warre and mariners that belonged to his nauie, left
the citie, and imbarking himselfe, sailed to the Ile of Shepie, and there remained all the winter.
In which meane while, Edmund Ironside came to London, where he was ioifullie receiued of
the citizens, and continuing there till the spring of the yeere, made himselfe strong against
the enimies.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote">1016.</span>
This Edmund for his noble courage, strength of bodie, and notable patience to indure and
suffer all such hardnesse and paines as is requisite in a man of warre, was surnamed Ironside,
&amp; began his reigne in the yéere of our Lord 1016, in the sixtéenth yéere of the emperor
Henrie the second surnamed Claudius, in the twentieth yéere of the reigne of Robert king
of France, &amp; about the sixt yéere of Malcolme the second king of the Scots. After that king
Edmund had receiued the crowne in the citie of London by the hands of the archbishop of
Yorke, he assembled togither such a power as he could make, and with the same marched
foorth towards the west parts, and made the countrie subiect to him. In the meane time
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran. Higd.</i></span>
was Cnute proclaimed and ordeined king at Southampton by the bishops and abbats, and
diuerse lords also of the temporaltie there tógither assembled, vnto whome he sware to be
their good and faithfull souereigne, and that he would sée iustice trulie and vprightlie ministred.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hen. Hunt. <br />Simon Dun.</i> <br />London besieged.</span>
After he had ended his businesse at Southampton, he drew with his people towards London,
and comming thither, besieged the citie both by water and land, causing a great trench
to be cast about it, so that no man might either get in or come foorth. Manie great assalts he<a name="page722" id="page722"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;722]</span>
caused to be giuen vnto the citie, but the Londoners and others within so valiantlie defended
the wals and gates, that the enimies got small aduantage, and at length were constreined to
depart with losse.
<span class="rightnote">Cnute at Gillingham in Dorsetshire put to flight. <br /><i>Polydor.</i></span>
Cnute then perceiuing that he might not haue his purpose there, withdrew
westward, and besides Gillingham in Dorsetshire, incountred with K. Edmund in the Rogation
weeke, and after sore &amp; sharpe battell was put to the woorse, and constreined to forsake
the field by the high prowesse &amp; manhood of the said Edmund. King Cnute the same night,
after the armies were seuered, departed towards Winchester, so to get himselfe out of danger.
<span class="rightnote">Salisburie besieged.</span>
Shortlie after, king Edmund hearing that an other armie of the Danes had besieged Salisburie,
marched thither to succour them within, and immediatlie Cnute followed him, so that at a
<span class="leftnote"><i>Simon Dun. <br />Matth. West.</i> <br /><i>Wil. Malm.</i> <br />A battel with equall fortune.</span>
place in Worcestershire called Scorastan, on the foure and twentith of June, they incountred
togither, and fought a verie cruell battell, which at length the night parted with equall fortune.
<span class="rightnote">An other batttel with like successes. </span>
And likewise on the next day they buckled togither againe, and fought with like successe
as they had doone the day before, for towards euening they gaue ouer well wearied, and
not knowing to whome the victorie ought to be ascribed.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Edrike de Streona his treason. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
Writers haue reported, that this second day, when duke Edrike perceiued the Englishmen
to be at point to haue got the vpper hand, he withdrew aside, and hauing by chance slaine a
common souldier called Osmear, which in visage much resembled king Edmund, whose head
he cut off, held it vp, &amp; shaking his swoord bloudie with the slaughter, cried to the Englishmen;
"Flée ye wretches, flee and get awaie, for your king is dead, behold heere his head
which I hold in my hands." Héerewith had the Englishmen fled immediatlie, if king Edmund
aduised of this stratagem, had not quicklie got him to an high ground where his men
might seé him aliue and lustie. Héerewith also the traitor Edrike escaped hardlie the danger
of death, the Englishmen shot so egerlie at him. At length, as is said, the night parting
them in sunder, they withdrew the one armie from the other, as it had béene by consent.
The third day they remained in armor, but yet absteining from battell, sate still, in taking
meate and drinke to relieue their wearied bodies, and after gathered in heapes the dead carcases
<span class="rightnote">Twentie thousand dead bodies. </span>
that had béene slaine in the former fight, the number of which on either partie reckoned,
rose to the point of twentie thousand and aboue.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote">The armies dislodged.</span>
In the night following, Cnute remooued his campe in secret wise, and marched towards
London, which citie in a maner remained besieged by the nauie of the Danes. King Edmund
in the morning when the light had discouered the departure of his enimies, followed them
by the tract, and comming to London with small adoo remooued the siege, and entered the
<span class="rightnote">The Danes ouercome at Brentford. <br /><i>Wil. Malm.</i> <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i>
<br /><i>Fabian</i>. <br /><i>Caxton</i>. <br /><i>Polydor</i>.</span>
citie like a conqueror. Shortlie after he fought with the Danes at Brentford, and gaue them
a great ouerthrow. In this meane while queene Emma the widow of king Egelred, doubting
the fortune of the warre, sent hir two sonnes Alfred and Edward ouer into Normandie vnto
hir brother duke Richard, or rather fled thither hirselfe with them (as some write.)</p>
<p>
Moreouer, earle Edrike, perceiuing the great manhood of king Edmund, began to feare,
least in the end he should subdue and vanquish the Danes, wherefore he sought meanes to
conclude a peace, and take such order with him as might stand with both their contentations,
which yer long he brought about. This was doone (as you shall heare) by the consent of
<span class="leftnote"><i>Henr. Hunt.</i></span>
Cnute (as some write) to the intent that Edrike being put in trust with king Edmund, might
the more easilie deuise waies how to betraie him. But Cnute disappointed of his purpose
at London, and fetching a great bootie and preie out of the countries next adjoining, repared
to his ships, to sée what order was amongst them, which a little before were withdrawen into
<span class="rightnote">The river of Medwaie.</span>
the riuer that passeth by Rochester called Medwaie. Héere Cnute remained certeine daies,
both to assemble a greater power, and also to hearken and learne what his enimies ment to
doo, the which he easilie vnderstood.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">King Edmund's diligence</span>
King Edmund, who hated nothing woorse than to linger his businesse, assembled his people,
and marching forward toward his enimies, approched néere vnto them, &amp; pitcht downe
his tents not farre from his enimies campe, exhorting his people to remember their passed
victories, and to doo their good willes, at length by one battell so to ouerthrow them, that
they might make an end of the warre, and dispatch them cleerelie out of the realme. With<a name="page723" id="page723"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;723]</span>
these and the like woords he did so incourage his souldiers, that they disdaining thus to haue
the enimies dailie prouoke them, and to put them to trouble, with eger minds and fierce
courages offered battell to the Danes, which Cnute had prepared to receiue whensoeuer the
Englishmen approched: and heerewith bringing his men into araie, he came foorth to méet
<span class="rightnote">The battell is begun.</span>
his enimies. Then was the battell begun with great earnestnesse on both sides, &amp; continued
foure houres, till at length the Danes began somewhat to shrinke, which when Cnute
perceiued, he commanded his horssemen to come forward into the forepart of his dawnted
host.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The Danes put to flight.</span>
But whilest one part of the Danes gaue backe with feare, and the other came slowlie forward,
the arraie of the whole armie was broken, &amp; then without respect of shame they fled
<span class="leftnote">The number of Danes slaine. <br /><i>Polydor.</i> <br /><i>Fabian.</i> <br /><i>Ran. Higd.</i>
<br /><i>Matt. West.</i> <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i> <br /><i> Will. Malmes.</i></span>
amaine, so that there died that day of Cnutes side foure thousand and fiue hundred men;
and of king Edmunds side, not past six hundred, and those were footmen. This battell
was fought as should appéere by diuerse writers, at Okefort or Oteford. It was thought,
that if king Edmund had pursued the victorie and followed in chase of his enimies in such
wise as he safelie might haue doone, he had made that day an end of the warres: but he
<span class="rightnote">Edriks counsell.</span>
was counselled by Edrike (as some write) in no condition to follow them, but to staie and
giue time to his people to refresh their wearie bodies. Then Cnute with his armie passed
ouer the Thames into Essex, and there assembled all his power togither, and began to spoile
and waste the countrie on each hand. King Edmund aduertised thereof, hasted foorth to
succour his people, and at Ashdone in Essex three miles from Saffron Walden, gaue battell
to Cnute, where after sore and cruell fight continued with great slaughter on both sides a
long time, duke Edrike fled to the comfort of the Danes, and to the discomfort of the
Englishmen.</p>
<p>
Héerevpon king Edmund was constreined in the end to depart out of the field, hauing first
doone all that could be wished in a woorthie chieftaine, both by woords to incourage his
men, &amp; by deeds to shew them good example; so that at one time the Danes were at point
to haue giuen backe, but that Cnute aduised thereof, rushed into the left wing where most
danger was, and so relieued his people there, that finallie the Englishmen, both wearied with
long fight, and also discouraged with the running awaie of some of their companie, were constreined
to giue ouer, and by flight to séeke their safegard, so that king Edmund might not
by anie meanes bring them againe into order. Héerevpon all the waies and passages being
<span class="rightnote">[*<i>Sic</i>.]</span>
forelaid and stopped by the enimies, the Englishmen wanting both carriage* to make longer
resistance, and perceiuing no hope to rest in fléeing, were beaten downe and slaine in heapes,
so that few escaped from that dreadfull and bloudie battell.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote">Noble men slaine at the battell of Ashdone. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i> <br /><i>Wil. Malm.</i></span>
There died on king Edmunds side, duke Edmund, duke Alfrike, and duke Goodwine,
with earle Vlfekettell or Vrchell of Eastangle, and duke Aileward, that was sonne to Ardelwine
late duke of Eastangle; and to be briefe, all the floure of the English nobilitie. There
were also slaine at this battell manie renowmed persons of the spiritualtie, as the bishop of
<span class="rightnote">King Edmund withdraweth into Glocestershire.</span>
Lincolne, and the abbat of Ramsey, with others: king Edmund escaping awaie, got him into
Glocestershire, and there began to raise a new armie. In the place where this field was
fought, are yet seuen or eight hils, wherein the carcases of them that were slaine at the same
field were buried: and one being digged downe of late, there were found two bodies in a
coffin of stone, of which the one laie with his head towards the others féet, and manie
chaines of iron, (like to the water-chains of the bits of horsses) were found in the same hill.

<h3>THE TENTH CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
In the meane while that Edmund was busie to leauie a new armie in Glocester, and other
parties of Mercia, Cnute hauing got so great a victorie (as before is mentioned) receiued
into his obeisance, not onelie the citie of London, but also manie other cities and townes of
great name, and shortlie after hasted forward to pursue his enimie king Edmund, who was
readie with a mightie host to trie the vttermost chance of battell if they should eftsoones
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
ioine. Héerevpon, both the armies being readie to giue the onset, the one in sight of the
other at a place called Dearehurst, neere to the riuer of Seuerne, by the drift of duke Edrike,
<span class="leftnote"><i>Matth. West.</i> <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
who then at length began to shew some token of good meaning, the two kings came to a
communication, and in the end concluded an agreement, as some haue written, without
anie more adoo. Others write, that when both the armies were at point to haue ioined,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth. West.</i> <br />saith this was Edrike.</span>
one of the capteins (but whether he were a Dane or an Englishman, it is not certeinlie told)
stood vp in such a place, as he might be heard of both the princes, &amp; boldlie vttered his
mind in forme following.</p>
<p class="center">
<i>The oration of a capteine in the audience of the English and Danish armie.</i></p>
<p>
"We haue, most woorthie capteins, fought long inough one against another, there hath
beene but too much bloud shed betweene both the nations, and the valiancie of the souldiers
on both sides is sufficientlie seene by triall, &amp; either of your manhoods likewise, and yet can
you beare neither good nor euill fortune. If one of you win the battell, he pursueth him
that is ouercome; and if he chance to be vanquished, he resteth not till he haue recouered
new strength to fight eftsoones with him that is victor. What should you meane by this
your inuincible courage? At what marke shooteth your greedie desire to beare rule, and your
excessive thirst to atteine honour? If you fight for a kingdome, diuide it betwéene you two,
which sometime was sufficient for seuen kings: but if you couet to winne fame and glorious
renowme, and for the same are driuen to try the hazard whether ye shall command or
obeie, deuise the waie whereby ye may without so great slaughter, and without such pitifull
bloudshed of both your guiltlesse peoples, trie whether of you is most woorthie to be
preferred."</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The two kings appoint to try the matter by a combat. <br />Oldney.</span>
Thus made he an end, and the two princes allowed well of his last motion, and so order
was taken, that they should fight togither in a singular combat within a litle Iland inclosed
with the riuer of Seuerne called Oldney, with condition, that whether of them chanced to
be victor, should be king, and the other to resigne his title for euer into his hands. The two
princes entering into the place appointed, in faire armour, began the battell in sight of both
their armies ranged in goodlie order on either side the riuer, with doubtfull minds, and nothing
ioifull, as they that wauered betwixt hope and feare. The two champions manfullie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt. Westm.</i> <br />Cnute of what stature he was.</span>
assailed either other, without sparing. First, they went to it on horssebacke, and after on
foot. Cnute was a man of a meane stature, but yet strong and hardie, so that receiuing a<a name="page725" id="page725"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;725]</span>
great blow by the hand of his aduersarie, which caused him somewhat to stagger; yet
recouered himselfe, and boldly stept forward to be reuenged. But perceiuing he could not
<span class="leftnote">Cnute ouermatched.</span>
find aduantage, and that he was rather too weake, and shrewdlie ouermatched, he spake to
<span class="rightnote">Cnutes woords to Edmund.</span>
Edmund with a lowd voice on this wise: "What necessitie (saith he) ought thus to mooue
vs, most valiant prince, that for the obteining of a kingdome, we should thus put our
liues in danger? Better were it that laieng armour and malice aside, we should condescend
to some reasonable agreement. Let vs become sworne brethren, and part the kingdome
<span class="leftnote"><i>H. Hunt.</i></span>
betwixt vs: and let vs deale so friendlie, that thou maist vse my things as thine owne, and
I thine as though they were mine." King Edmund with those woords of his aduersarie
was so pacified, that immediatlie he cast awaie his swoord, and comming to Cnute, ioined
<span class="rightnote">They make vp the matter betwixt themselves.</span>
hands with him. Both the armies by their example did the like, which looked for the
same fortune to fall on their countries, which should happen to their princes by the successe
of that one battell. After this, there was an agréement deuised betwixt them, so that
a partition of the realme was made, and that part that lieth fore against France, was assigned
<span class="leftnote"><i>Wil. Malm.</i></span>
to Edmund, and the other fell to Cnute. There be that write, how the offer was
made by king Edmund for the auoiding of more bloudshed, that the two princes should
trie the matter thus togither in a singular combat. But Cnute refused the combat, bicause
(as he alledged) the match was not equall. For although he was able to match Edmund
in boldnesse of stomach, yet was he farre too weake to deale with a man of such strength
as Edmund was knowne to be. But sith they did pretend title to the realme by due and
good direct meanes, he thought it most conuenient that the kingdome should be diuided
betwixt them. This motion was allowed of both the armies, so that king Edmund was
of force constreined to be contented therewith.</p>
<p>
¶ Thus our common writers haue recorded of this agréement, but if I should not be
thought presumptuous, in taking vpon me to reprooue, or rather but to mistrust that which
hath béene receiued for a true narration in this matter, I would rather giue credit vnto that
<span class="rightnote"><i>Encomium Emmæ.</i></span>
which the author of the booke intituled "Encomium Emmæ," dooth report in this behalfe.
Which is that through persuasion of Edrike de Streona, king Edmund immediatelie after
the battell fought at Ashdone, sent ambassadors vnto Cnute to offer vnto him peace, with
halfe the realme of England, that is to say, the north parts, with condition that king Edmund
might quietlie inioy the south parts, and therevpon haue pledges deliuered interchangeablie
on either side.</p>
<p>
Cnute hauing heard the effect of this message, staied to make answer till he heard what
his councell would aduise him to doo in this behalfe: and vpon good deliberation taken in
the matter, considering that he had lost no small number of people in the former battell, and
that being farre out of his countrie, he could not well haue anie new supplie, where the
Englishmen although they had likewise lost verie manie of their men of warre, yet being in
their owne countrie, it should be an easie matter for them to restore their decaid number, it
was thought expedient by the whole consent of all the Danish capteins, that the offer of king
Edmund should be accepted.</p>
<p>
Herevpon Cnute calling the ambassadors before him againe, declared vnto them, that he
was contented to conclude a peace vpon such conditions as they had offered: but yet with
this addition, that their king whatsoeuer he should be, should paie Cnutes souldiers their
wages, with monie to be leuied of that part of the kingdome which the English king should
possesse. "For (this saith he) I haue vndertaken to sée them paid, and otherwise I will
not grant to anie peace." The league and agréement therefore being concluded in this
sort, pledges were deliuered and receiued on both parties, and the armies discharged. But
<span class="rightnote">This is alleged touching the partiti&#333; of the kingdome.</span>
God (saith mine author) being mindfull of his old doctrine, that Euerie kingdome diuided
in it selfe cannot long stand, shortlie after tooke Edmund out of this life: and by such
meanes séemed to take pitie of the English kingdome, lest if both the kings should haue
continued in life togither, they should haue liued in danger. And incontinentlie herevpon
was Cnute chosen and receiued for absolute king of all the whole realme of England. Thus<a name="page726" id="page726"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;726]</span>
hath he written that liued in those daies, whose credit thereby is much aduanced.</p>
<p>
Howbeit the common report of writers touching the death of Edmund varieth from this,
who doo affirme, that after Cnute and Edmund were made friends, the serpent of enuie and
false conspiracie burnt so in the hearts of some traitorous persons, that within a while after
<span class="rightnote">K. Edmund traitorouslie slaine at Oxford.<br /><i>Fabian.</i> <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
king Edmund was slaine at Oxford, as he sat on a priuie to doo the necessaries of nature.
The common report hath gone, that earle Edrike was the procurer of this villanous act, and
that (as some write) his sonne did it. But the author that wrote "Encomium Emmæ,"
writing of the death of Edmund, hath these words (immediatlie after he had first declared
in what sort the two princes were agréed, and had made partition of the realme betwixt
<span class="leftnote">This is alleged againe for the proofe of Edmunds natural death.</span>
them:) But God (saith he) being mindfull of his old doctrine, that Euerie kingdome diuided
in it selfe can not long stand, shortlie after tooke Edmund out of this life: and by such
meanes séemed to take pitie vpon the English kingdome, least if both the kings should haue
continued in life togither, they should both haue liued in great danger, and the realme in
trouble. With this agreeth also Simon Dunel. who saith, that king Edmund died of naturall
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i></span>
sicknesse, by course of kind at London, about the feast of saint Andrew next insuing the
late mentioned agreement.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ranul. Hig.</i> <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i></span>
And this should séeme true: for whereas these authors which report, that earle Edrike
was the procurer of his death, doo also write, that when he knew the act to be done, he
hasted vnto Cnute, and declared vnto him what he had brought to passe for his aduancement
to the gouernment of the whole realme. Wherevpon Cnute, abhorring such a detestable
fact, said vnto him: "Bicause thou hast for my sake, made away the worthiest
bodie of the world, I shall raise thy head aboue all the lords of England," and so caused him
<span class="rightnote">Some thinke that he was duke of Mercia before, and now had Essex adioined thereto.</span>
to be put to death. Thus haue some bookes. Howbeit this report agreeth not with other
writers, which declare how Cnute aduanced Edrike in the beginning of his reigne vnto high
honor, and made him gouernor of Mercia, and vsed his counsell in manie things after the
death of king Edmund, as in banishing Edwin, the brother of king Edmund, with his sonnes
also, Edmund and Edward.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Diuerse and discordant reports of Edmunds death. <br /><i>Ran. Higd.</i> <br /><i>Wil. Malm.</i></span>
But for that there is such discordance and variable report amongst writers touching the
death of king Edmund, and some fables inuented thereof (as the manner is) we will let
the residue of their reports passe; sith certeine it is, that to his end he came, after he had
reigned about the space of one yéere, and so much more as is betwéene the moneth of Iune
and the latter end of Nouember. His bodie was buried at Glastenburie, neere his vncle
Edgar. With this Edmund, surnamed Ironside, fell the glorious maiestie of the English
kingdome, the which afterward as it had beene an aged bodie being sore decaied and
weakened by the Danes, that now got possession of the whole, yet somewhat recouered after
the space of 26 yéers vnder king Edward, surnamed the Confessor: and shortlie therevpon
as it had béene falne into a resiluation, came to extreame ruine by the inuasion and conquest
of the Normans: as after by Gods good helpe and fauorable assistance it shall appeare. So
that it would make a diligent and marking reader both muse and moorne, to see how
variable the state of this kingdome hath béene, &amp; thereby to fall into a consideration of the
frailtie and vncerteintie of this mortall life, which is no more frée from securitie, than a ship
on the sea in tempestuous weather. For as the casualties wherewith our life is inclosed
and beset with round about, are manifold; so also are they miserable, so also are they sudden,
so also are they vnauoidable. And true it is, that the life of man is in the hands of
God, and the state of kingdoms dooth also belong vnto him, either to continue or discontinue.
But to the processe of the matter.</p>

<h3>THE XJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">CANUTE, KNOUGHT OR CNUTE.</span>
Canute, or Cnute, whome the English chronicles doo name Knought, after the death
of king Edmund, tooke vpon him the whole rule ouer all the realme of England, in the
<span class="leftnote">1017.</span>
yéere of our Lord 1017, in the seuentéenth yeere of the emperour Henrie the second, surnamed
Claudus, in the twentith yéere of the reigne of Robert king of France, and about the
7 yeere of Malcolme king of Scotland. Cnute shortlie after the death of king Edmund,
assembled a councell at London, in the which he caused all the nobles of the realme to doo
him homage, in receiuing an oth of loiall obeisance. He diuided the realme into foure
parts, assigning Northumberland vnto the rule of Irke or Iricius, Mercia vnto Edrike, and
Eastangle vnto Turkill, and reseruing the west part to his owne gouernance. He banished
(as before is said) Edwin, the brother of king Edmund; but such as were suspected to be
culpable of Edmunds death, he caused to be put to execution: whereby it should appeere,
that Edrike was not then in anie wise detected or once thought to be giltie.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malm.</i> <br /><i>Ran. Higd.</i> <br />King of churles. <br /><i>Wil. Malm.</i></span>
The said Edwin afterwards returned, and was then reconciled to the kings fauor (as some
write) but shortlie after traitorouslie slaine by his owne seruants. He was called the king
of churles. Others write, that he came secretlie into the realme after he had béene banished,
and kéeping himselfe closelie out of sight, at length ended his life, and was buried at Tauestocke.
Moreouer, Edwin and Edward the sonnes of king Edmund were banished the land,
<span class="leftnote"><i>Ran. Higd.</i></span>
and sent first vnto Sweno king of Norweie to haue bin made away: but Sweno vpon remorse
of conscience sent them into Hungarie, where they found great fauor at the hands of
king Salomon, insomuch that Edwin maried the daughter of the same Salomon, but had no
issue by hir. Edward was aduanced to marie with Agatha, daughter of the emperour Henrie,
and by hir had issue two sonnes, Edmund and Edgar surnamed Edeling, and as many
daughters, Margaret and Christine, of the which in place conuenient more shall be said.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> <br />King Cnute maried to quéene Emma the widow of Egelred,
in Iulie, anno. 1017.</span>
When king Cnute had established things, as he thought stood most for his suertie, he
called to his remembrance, that he had no issue but two bastard sonnes Harold and Sweno,
begotten of his concubine Alwine. Wherefore he sent ouer to Richard duke of Normandie,
requiring to haue quéene Emma, the widow of king Egelred in mariage, and so obteined
hir, not a little to the woonder of manie, which thought a great ouersight both in the woman
<span class="leftnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
and in hir brother, that would satisfie the request of Cnute herein, considering he had
béene such a mortall enimie to hir former husband. But duke Richard did not onelie consent,
that his said sister should be maried vnto Cnute, but also he himselfe tooke to wife
the ladie Hestritha, sister to the said Cnute.</p>
<p>
¶ Here ye haue to vnderstand, that this mariage was not made without great consideration
<span class="rightnote">The couenants made at the mariage betwixt Cnute and Emma.</span>
&amp; large couenants granted on the part of king Cnute: for before he could obteine queene
Emma to his wife, it was fullie condescended &amp; agréed, that after Cnuts decease, the crowne
of England should remaine to the issue borne of this mariage betwixt hir &amp; Cnute, which
couenant although it was not performed immediatlie after the deceasse of king Cnute, yet
in the end it tooke place, so as the right séemed to be deferred, and not to be taken away
nor abolished: for immediatlie vpon Harolds death that had vsurped, Hardicnute succéeded<a name="page728" id="page728"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;728]</span>
as right heire to the crowne, by force of the agréement made at the time of the mariage
solemnized betwixt his father and mother, and being once established in the kingdome, he
ordeined his brother Edward to succéed him, whereby the Danes were vtterlie excluded
from all right that they had to pretend vnto the crowne of this land, and the English bloud
restored thereto, chieflie by that gratious conclusion of this mariage betwixt king Cnute and
<span class="rightnote">The English bloud restored. The praise of quéene Emma for hir wisdome.</span>
quéene Emma. For the which no small praise was thought to be due vnto the said quéene,
sith by hir politike gouernement, in making hir match so beneficiall to hir selfe and hir line,
the crowne was thus recouered out of the hands of the Danes, and restored againe in time

But now to our purpose. Cnute the same yeare in which he was thus maried, through
persuasion of his wife quéene Emma, sent awaie the Danish nauie and armie home into Denmarke,
giuing to them fourescore and two thousand pounds of siluer, which was leuied
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Malm.</i> <br />1018.</span>
throughout this land for their wages. In the yeare 1018, Edrike de Streona earle of Mercia
was ouerthrowen in his owne turne: for being called before the king into his priuie chamber,
and there in reasoning the matter about some quarrell that was picked to him, he began verie
presumptuouslie to vpbraid the king of such pleasures as he had before time doone vnto
him; "I did (said he) for the loue which I bare towards you, forsake my souereigne lord
king Edmund, and at length for your sake slue him." At which words Cnute began to
change countenance, as one maruellouslie abashed, and straightwaies gaue sentence against
Edrike in this wise; "Thou art woorthie (saith he) of death, and die thou shalt, which
art guiltie of treason both towards God and me, sith that thou hast slaine thine own souereigne
lord, and my déere alied brother. Thy bloud therefore be vpon thine owne head,
sith thy toong hath vttered thy treason." And immediatlie he caused his throat to be cut,
and his bodie to be throwen out at the chamber window into the riuer of Thames. ¶ But
<span class="rightnote">Edrike put to death.</span>
others say, that hands were laid vpon him in the verie same chamber or closet where he murdered
the king, &amp; straightwaies to preuent all causes of tumults &amp; hurlieburlies, he was put
to death with terrible torments of fierbrands &amp; links; which execution hauing passed vpon
him, a second succeeded; for both his féet were bound together, and his bodie drawne
through the streets of the citie, &amp; in fine cast into a common ditch called Houndsditch; for
that the citizens threw their dead dogs and stinking carrion with other filth into it, accounting
him worthie of a worse rather than of a better buriall. In such hatred was treason had,
being a vice which the verie infidels and grosse pagans abhorred, else would they not haue
said, <i>Proditionem amo, proditorem odi</i>; Treason I loue, but a traitor I hate. This was the
end of Edrike, surnamed de Stratten or Streona, a man of great infamie for his craftie dissimulation,
falshood and treason, vsed by him to the ouerthrow of the English estate, as
partlie before is touched.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon Dun.</i> <i>Encomium Emmæ.</i></span>
But there be that concerning the cause of this Edriks death, séeme partlie to disagrée from
that which before is recited, declaring that Cnute standing in some doubt to be betraied
through the treason of Edrike, sought occasion how to rid him and others (whome he mistrusted)
out of the way. And therefore on a day when Edrike craued some preferment at
Cnuts hands, &amp; said that he had deserued to be well thought of, sith by his flight from the
battell at Ashendon, the victorie therby inclined to Cnutes part: Cnute hearing him speake
these words, made this answere: "And canst thou (quoth he) be true to me, that through
fraudulent meanes diddest deceiue thy soùereigne lord and maister? But I will reward thée
according to thy deserts, so as from henceforth thou shalt not deceiue anie other," and so
forthwith commanded Erike one of his chiefe capteines to dispatch him, who incontinentlie
cut off his head with his axe or halbert. Verelie Simon Dunelmensis saith, that K. Cnute
vnderstanding in what sort both king Egelred, and his sonne king Edmund Ironside had
béene betraied by the said Edrike, stood in great doubt to be likewise deceiued by him, and
therefore was glad to haue some pretended quarell, to dispatch both him and others, whome<a name="page729" id="page729"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;729]</span>
he likewise mistrusted, as it well appeared. For at the same time there were put to death
with Edrike earle Norman the sonne of earle Leofwin, and brother to earle Leofrike: also
Adelward the sonne of earle Agelmare and Brightrike the sonne of Alfegus gouernor of
Deuonshire, without all guilt or cause (as some write.) And in place of Norman, his brother
Leofrike was made earle of Mercia by the king, and had in great fauour. This Leofrike is
commonlie also by writers named earle of Chester. After this, Cnute likewise banished Iric
and Turkill, two Danes, the one (as before is recited) gouernor of Northumberland, and the
other of Northfolke and Suffolke or Eastangle.</p>
<p>
Then rested the whole rule of the realme in the kings hands, wherevpon he studied to
preserue the people in peace, and ordeined lawes, according to the which both Danes and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hen. Hunt.</i> <br />Lords put to death.</span>
Englishmen should be gouerned in equall state and degrée. Diuers great lords whome he
found vnfaithfull or rather suspected, he put to death (as before ye haue heard) beside such
as he banished out of the realme.  He raised a tax or tribute of the people, amounting to
<span class="rightnote">A taxe raised.</span>
the summe of fourescore &amp; two thousand pounds, besides 11000 pounds, which the Londoners
paid towards the maintenance of the Danish armie.  But whereas these things
chaunced not all at one time, but in sundrie seasons, we will returne somewhat backe to declare
what other exploits were atchiued in the meane time by Cnute, not onelie in England,
but also in Denmarke, and elsewhere: admonishing the reader in the processe of the discourse
following, that much excellent matter is comprehended, whereout (if the same be
studiouslie read and diligentlie considered) no small profit is to be reaped, both for the augmentation
of his owne knowledge and others that be studious.</p>

<h3>THE TWELFTH CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">1019. <br />King Cnute passeth into Denmarke.</span>
In the third yeare of his reigne Cnute sailed with an armie of Englishmen and Danes into
Denmarke, to subdue the Vandals there, which then sore annoied and warred against his
<span class="leftnote">Earle Goodwin his seruice in Denmarke.</span>
subiects of Denmarke. Earle Goodwine, which had the souereigne conduct of the Englishmen,
the night before the day appointed for the battell got him forth of the campe with
his people, and suddenlie assailing the Vandals in their lodgings, easilie distressed them,
sleaing a great number of them, and chasing the residue. In the morning earlie, when as
Cnute heard that the Englishmen were gone foorth of their lodgings, he supposed that they
were either fled awaie, or else turned to take part with the enimies. But as he approched to
the enimies campe, he vnderstood how the mater went; for he found nothing there but
<span class="rightnote">Cnute had the Englishmen in estimation for their good service.</span>
bloud, dead bodies, and the spoile. For which good seruice, Cnute had the Englishmen
in more estimation euer after, and highlie rewarded their leader the same earle Goodwine.
When Cnute had ordered all things in Denmarke, as was thought behoofefull, he returned
againe into England: and within a few daies after, he was aduertised that the Swedeners
made warre against his subiects of Denmarke, vnder the leding of two great princes, Vlfe
<span class="rightnote">1028. <br />Cnute passeth againe into Denmarke. <br /><i>Will. Malm.</i></span>
and Vlafe. Wherefore to defend his dominions in those parts, he passed againe with an
armie into Denmarke, incountred with his enimies, and receiued a sore ouerthrow, loosing
a great number both of Danes and Englishmen. But gathering togither a new force of men,<a name="page730" id="page730"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;730]</span>
he set againe vpon his enimies, and ouercame them, constreining the two foresaid princes to
<span class="leftnote"><i>Matt. Westm.</i></span>
agrée vpon reasonable conditions of peace. Matth. West. recounteth, that at this time earle
Goodwine and the Englishmen wrought the enterprise aboue mentioned, of assaulting the enimies
campe in the night season, after Cnute had first lost in the day before no small number
of his people: and that then the foresaid princes or kings, as he nameth them Vlfus and Aulafus,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Albertus Crantz.</i></span>
which latter he calleth Eiglafe, were constrained to agrée vpon a peace. The Danish
chronicles alledge, that the occasion of this warre rose hereof. This Olauus aided Cnute (as
the same writers report) against king Edmund and the Englishmen. But when the peace
should be made betwéene Cnute and Edmund, there was no consideration had of Olauus:
whereas through him the Danes chieflie obteined the victorie. Herevpon Olauus was sore
offended in his mind against Cnute, and now vpon occasion sought to be reuenged. But what
soeuer the cause was of this warre betwixt these two princes, the end was thus: that Olauus
was expelled out of his kingdome, and constreined to flée to Gerithaslaus a duke in the parties
of Eastland, and afterward returning into Norwaie, was slaine by such of his subiects
as tooke part with Cnute, in manner as in the historie of Norwaie, appeareth more at large,
with the contrarietie found in the writings of them which haue recorded the histories of
<span class="rightnote">Magnus Olauus.</span>
those north regions.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i> <br /><i>Polydor.</i> <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i></span>
But here is to be remembred, that the fame and glorie of the English nation was greatlie
aduanced in these warres, as well against the Swedeners as the Norwegians, so that Cnute
began to loue and trust the Englishmen much better than it was to be thought he would euer
<span class="leftnote">Other say, that he went forth of Denmarke to Rome. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i> <br />Anno 1031. <br />1032. <br /><i>Wil. Malm.</i> <br /><i>Matth. West.</i> <br />1033.</span>
haue doone. Shortlie after that Cnute was returned into England, that is to say (as some haue)
in the 15 yeare of his reigne, he went to Rome to performe his vow which he had made
to visit the places where the apostles Peter and Paule had their buriall, where he was honorablie
receiued of pope Iohn the 20 that then held the sée. When he had doone his deuotion
there, he returned into England. In the yeare following, he made a iournie against the Scots,

which as then had rebelled; but by the princelie power of Cnute they were subdued and
brought againe to obedience: so that not onelie king Malcolme, but also two other kings
Melbeath and Ieohmare became his subiects. Finallie after that this noble prince king Cnute

had reigned the tearme of 20 yeares currant, after the death of Ethelred, he died at Shaftsburie,
as the English writers affirme, on the 12 of Nouember, and was buried at Winchester.
But the Danish chronicles record that he died in Normandie, and was buried at Rome (as in
the same chronicles ye may reade more at large.)</p>

<h3>THE XIIJ. CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The large dominion of K. Cnute. <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i> <br /><i>Alb. Crantz.</i></span>
This Cnute was the mightiest prince that euer reigned ouer the English people: for he
had the souereigne rule ouer all Denmark, England, Norwaie, Scotland, and part of Sweiden.
Amongest other of his roiall acts, he caused such tolles and tallages as were demanded
of way-goers at bridges and stréets in the high way betwixt England and Rome to be diminished
to the halfes, and againe got also a moderation to be had in the paiment of the archbishops<a name="page731" id="page731"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;731]</span>
fees of his realme, which was leuied of them in the court of Rome when they should
receiue their palles, as may appeare by a letter which he himselfe being at Rome, directed to
the bishops and other of the nobles of England. In the which it also appeareth, that besides
the roiall interteinment, which he had at Rome of pope Iohn, he had conference there
with the emperour Conrad, with Rafe the king of Burgongne, and manie other great princes
and noble men, which were present there at that time: all which at his request, in fauour
<span class="rightnote">Grants made to the benefit of Englishmen, at the instance of king Cnute.
<i>Fabian</i>. <i>Polydor</i>. <br /><i>Matt. West.</i></span>
of those Englishmen that should trauell vnto Rome, granted (as we haue said) to diminish
such duties as were gathered of passingers.</p>
<p>
He receiued there manie great gifts of the emperour, and was highlie honored of him, and
likewise of the pope, and of all other the high princes at that time present at Rome: so that
when he came home (as some write) he did grow greatlie into pride, insomuch that being
<span class="leftnote"> He caused his chaire to be set there, as <br /><i>Matth. West.</i> saith. <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i></span>
néere to the Thames, or rather (as other write) vpon the sea strand, néere to Southhampton,
and perceiuing the water to rise by reason of the tide, he cast off his gowne, and wrapping
it round togither, threw it on the sands verie neere the increasing water, and sat him downe
vpon it, speaking these or the like words to the sea: "Thou art (saith he) within the compasse
of my dominion, and the ground whereon I sit is mine, and thou knowest that no wight dare
disobeie my commandements; I therefore doo now command thée not to rise vpon my
ground, nor to presume to wet anie part of thy souereigne lord and gouernour."  But the
sea kéeping hir course, rose still higher and higher, and ouerflowed not onelie the kings féet,
but also flashed vp vnto his legs and knees. Wherewith the king started suddenlie vp, and
<span class="rightnote">The saieng of king Cnute.</span>
withdrew from it, saieng withall to his nobles that were about him: "Behold you noble
men, you call me king, which can not so much as staie by my commandement this small portion
of water. But know ye for certeine, that there is no king but the father onelie of our Lord
Iesus Christ, with whome he reigneth, &amp; at whose becke all things are gouerned. Let vs
<span class="rightnote">Zealouslie inough, if it had bin according to true knowledge.</span>
therefore honor him, let vs confesse and professe him to be the ruler of heauen, earth, and
sea, and besides him none other."</p>
<p>
From thence he went to Winchester, and there with his owne hands set his crowne vpon the
head of the image of the crucifix, which stood there in the church of the apostles Peter and Paule,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran. Higd</i>. <br /><i>Polydor</i>. <br /><i>Matth. West.</i></span>
and from thenceforth he would neuer weare that crowne nor anie other. Some write that he
spake not the former words to the sea vpon anie presumptuousnesse of mind, but onelie vpon
<span class="leftnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
occasion of the vaine title, which in his commendation one of his gentlemen gaue him by way
of flatterie (as he rightlie tooke it) for he called him the most mightiest king of all kings,
<span class="rightnote">Flatterie reproued.</span>
which ruled most at large both men, sea, and land. Therefore to reprooue the fond flatterie
of such vaine persons, he deuised and practised the déed before mentioned, thereby both to
reprooue such flatterers, and also that men might be admonished to consider the omnipotencie
of almightie God. He had issue by his wife quéene Emma, a sonne named by the English
chronicles Hardiknought, but by the Danish writers Canute or Knute: also a daughter
named Gonilda, that was after maried to Henrie the sonne of Conrad, which also was afterwards
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
emperour, and named Henrie the third. By his concubine Alwine that was daughter
<span class="leftnote"><i>Alb. Cranz.</i></span>
to Alselme, whome some name earle of Hampton, he had two bastard sonnes, Harold and
Sweno. He was much giuen in his latter daies to vertue, as he that considered how perfect
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor</i>. <br /><i>Fabian</i>.</span>
felicitie rested onelie in godlines and true deuotion to serue the heauenlie king and gouernour
of all things.</p>
<p>
He repared in his time manie churches, abbeies and houses of religion, which by occasion
of warres had béene sore defaced by him and his father, but speciallie he did great cost vpon
the abbeie of saint Edmund, in the towne of Burie, as partlie before is mentioned. He also
<span class="rightnote">Which is supposed to be Barclow: for Ashdone it selfe
is halfe a mile from thence. <br />1020. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
built two abbeies from the foundation, as saint Benets in Norffolke, seuen miles distant from
Norwich, and an other in Norwaie. He did also build a church at Ashdone in Essex,
where he obteined the victorie of king Edmund, and was present at the hallowing or consecration
therof with a great multitude of the lords and nobles of the realme, both English
and Danes. He also holpe with his owne hands to remooue the bodie of the holie archbishop
Elphegus, when the same was translated from London to Canturburie. The roiall and most<a name="page732" id="page732"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;732]</span>
rich iewels which he &amp; his wife quéene Emma gaue vnto the church of Winchester, might
make the beholders to woonder at such their exceeding and bountifull munificence.</p>
<p>
Thus did Cnute striue to reforme all such things as he and his ancestors had doone amisse,
and to wipe awaie the spot of euill dooing, as suerlie to the outward sight of the world he did in
deed; he had the archbishop of Canturburie Achelnotus in singular reputation, and vsed his
<span class="rightnote">Leofrike earle of Chester.</span>
counsell in matters of importance. He also highlie fauoured Leofrike earle of Chester, so that
the same Leofrike bare great rule in ordering of things touching the state of the common
<span class="rightnote">King Cnutes lawes.</span>
wealth vnder him as one of his chiefe councellors. Diuerse lawes and statutes he made for the
gouernment of the common wealth, partlie agréeable with the lawes of king Edgar, and other
the kings that were his predecessors, and partlie tempered according to his owne liking, and as
was thought to him most expedient: among the which there be diuerse that concerne
causes as well ecclesiasticall as temporall. Whereby (as maister Fox hath noted) it maie be
gathered, that the gouernment of spirituall matters did depend then not vpon the bishop of
Rome, but rather apperteined vnto the lawfull authoritie of the temporall prince, no lesse than
matters and causes temporall. But of these lawes &amp; statutes enacted by king Cnute, ye may
read more as ye find them set foorth in the before remembred booke of maister William Lambert,
which for briefenesse we héere omit.</p>

<h3>THE XIIIJ. CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">HAROLD. <br /><i>Matth. West.</i> <br /><i>Wil. Malm.</i></span>
After that Cnute was departed this life, there arose much variance amongst the peeres
and great lords of the realme about the succession. The Danes and Londoners (which
through continuall familiaritie with the Danes, were become like vnto them) elected Harold the
<span class="leftnote">Controuersie for the crowne.</span>
base sonne of king Cnute, to succéed in his fathers roome, hauing earle Leofrike, and diuerse
other of the noble men of the north parts on their side. But other of the Englishmen, and
namelie earle Goodwine earle of Kent, with the chiefest lords of the west parts, coueted rather
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon Dun.</i> <br /><br />The realme diuided betwixt Harold and Hardicnute.</span>
to haue one of king Egelreds sonnes, which were in Normandie, or else Hardicnute the
sonne of king Cnute by his wife quéene Emma, which remained in Denmarke, aduanced to

the place. This controuersie held in such wise, that the realme was diuided (as some write)
by lot betwixt the two brethren Harold and Hardicnute. The north part, as Mercia and
Northumberland fell to Harold, and the south part vnto Hardicnute: but at length the
whole remained vnto Harold, bicause his brother Hardicnute refused to come out of Denmarke
to take the gouernment vpon him.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The authoritie of earle Goodwine. <br /><i>H. Hunt.</i></span>
But yet the authoritie of earle Goodwine, who had the queene and the treasure of the<a name="page733" id="page733"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;733]</span>
realme in his kéeping, staied the matter a certeine time, (professing himselfe as it were gardian
to the yoong men, the sonnes of the quéene, till at length he was constreined to giue ouer his
hold, and conforme himselfe to the stronger part and greater number.) And so at Oxford,
where the assemblie was holden about the election, Harold was proclaimed king, and consecrated
<span class="rightnote">The refusall of the archbishop Elnothus to consecrate king Harold.</span>
according to the maner (as some write.) But it should appeere by other, that Elnothus
the archbishop of Canturburie, a man indued with all vertue and wisedome, refused
to crowne him: for when king Harold being elected of the nobles and péeres, required
the said archbishop that he might be of him consecrated, and receiue at his hands
the regall scepter with the crowne, which the archbishop had in his custodie, and to whome it
onelie did apperteine to inuest him therewith, the archbishop flatlie refused, and with an oth
protested, that he would not consecrate anie other for king, so long as the quéenes children
liued: "for (saith he) Cnute committed them to my trust and assurance, and to them will I
kéepe my faith and loiall obedience. The scepter and crowne I héere lay downe vpon the
altar, and neither doo I denie nor deliuer them vnto you: but I forbid by the apostolike authoritie
all the bishops, that none of them presume to take the same awaie, and deliuer them
to you, or consecrate you for king. As for your selfe, if you dare, you maie vsurpe that
which I haue committed vnto God and his table."</p>
<p>
But whether afterwards the king by one meane or other, caused the archbishop to crowne
him king, or that he was consecrated of some other, he was admitted king of all the English
<span class="rightnote">1036.</span>
people, beginning his reigne in the yéere of our Lord a thousand thirtie and six, in the fouretenth
yéere of the emperor Conrad the second, in the sixt yéere of Henrie the first, king of
France, and about the seuen and twentith yéere of Malcolme the second, king of Scots. This
<span class="leftnote">Harold why he is surnamed Harefoot.</span>
Harold for his great swiftnesse, was surnamed Harefoot, of whome little is written touching his
dooings, sauing that he is noted to haue béene an oppressor of his people, and spotted with manie
<span class="rightnote">Harold euill spoken of. <br /><i>Ran. Higa. <br />ex Mariano.</i></span>
notable vices. It was spoken of diuerse in those daies, that this Harold was not the sonne
of Cnute, but of a shoomaker, and that his supposed mother Elgina, king Cnutes concubine,
to bring the king further in loue with hir, feined that she was with child: and about the time
that she should be brought to bed (as she made hir account) caused the said shoemakers
son to be secretlie brought into hir chamber, and then vntrulie caused it to be reported that
she was deliuered, and the child so reputed to be the kings sonne.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth. West.</i></span>
Immediatlie vpon aduertisement had of Cnutes death, Alfred the sonne of king Egelred,
with fiftie saile landed at Sandwich, meaning to challenge the crowne, and to obteine it by
lawfull claime with quietnesse, if he might; if not, then to vse force by aid of his friends, and
to assaie that waie foorth to win it, if he might not otherwise obteine it. From Sandwich he
came to Canturburie: and shortlie after, earle Goodwine feining to receiue him as a friend,
came to meet him, and at Gilford in the night season appointed a number of armed men to
fall vpon the Normans as they were asléepe, and so tooke them togither with Alfred, &amp; slue
the Normans by the poll, in such wise that nine were shine, &amp; the tenth reserued. But
yet when those that were reserued, seemed to him a greater number than he wished to escape,
he fell to and againe tithed them as before. Alfred had his eies put out, and was conueied
to the Ile of Elie, where shortlie after he died.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran. Higd.</i></span>
¶ How Alfred should claime the crowne to himselfe I sée not: for verelie I can not be persuaded
that he was the elder brother, though diuers authors haue so written, sith Gemeticensis,
&amp; the author of the booke called "Encomium Emmae," plainlie affirme, that Edward was the
elder: but it might be, that Alfred being a man of a stouter stomach than his brother Edward,
<span class="rightnote">Sée maister <i>Fox</i> acts and monuments, pag. 112. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i></span>
made this attempt, either for himselfe, or in the behalfe of his brother Edward, being
as then absent, and gone into Hungarie, as some write: but other say, that as well Edward as
Alfred came ouer at this time with a number of Norman knights, and men of warre imbarked
in a few ships, onelie to speake with their mother, who as then lay at Winchester, whether to
take aduise with hir how to recouer their right heere in this land, or to aduance their brother
Hardicnute, or for some other purpose, our authors doo not declare.</p>
<p>
But the lords of the realme that bare their good wils vnto Harold, and (though contrarie to right)<a name="page734" id="page734"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;734]</span>
ment to mainteine him in the estate, seemed to be much offended with the comming of these
two brethren in such order: for earle Goodwine persuaded them, that it was great danger to
suffer so manie strangers to enter the realme, as they had brought with them. Wherevpon
earle Goodwine with the assent of the other lords, or rather by commandement of Harold,
went foorth, and at Gilford met with Alfred that was comming towards king Harold to
speake with him, accordinglie as he was of Harold required to doo. But now being
taken, and his companie miserablie murthered (as before ye haue heard) to the number of
six hundred Normans, Alfred himselfe was sent into the Ile of Elie, there to remaine in the
abbeie in custodie of the moonks, hauing his eies put out as soone as he entered first into the
same Ile. William Malmesburie saith, that Alfred came ouer, and was thus handeled betwixt
the time of Harolds death, &amp; the comming in of Hardicnute. Others write, that this chanced
in his brother Hardicnuts daies, which séemeth not to be true: for Hardicnute was knowne to
loue his brethren by his mothers side too dearelie to haue suffered anie such iniurie to be
wrought against either of them in his time.</p>
<p>
¶ Thus ye sée how writers dissent in this matter, but for the better clearing of the truth
touching the time, I haue thought good to shew also what the author of the said booke intituled
"Encomium Emmæ" writeth hereof, which is as followeth. When Harold was once
established king, he sought meanes how to rid quéene Emma out of the way, and that secretlie,
for that openlie as yet he durst not attempt anie thing against hir. She in silence kept hir
selfe quiet, looking for the end of these things. But Harold remembring himselfe, of a malicious
purpose, by wicked aduise tooke counsell how he might get into his hands and make
away the sons of quéene Emma, &amp; so to be out of danger of all annoiance that by them might
be procured against him. Wherefore he caused a letter to be written in the name of their
<span class="rightnote">A counterfet letter.</span>
mother Emma, which he sent by certeine messengers suborned for the same purpose into
Normandie, where Edward and Alfred as then remained. The tenour of which letter here
insueth.</p>

For incessantlie he goeth from towne to towne, from citie to citie, and maketh the lords his

my request is, that one of you doo come with speed, and that priuilie ouer to me, that he may
vnderstand my wholesome aduise, and know in what sort this matter ought to be handled,
which I would haue to go forward, and see that ye send mee word by this present messenger
what you meane to doo herein. Fare ye well euen the bowels of my heart."</p>

<p>
These letters were deliuered vnto such as were made priuie to the purposed treason, who<a name="page735" id="page735"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;735]</span>
being fullie instructed how to deale, went ouer into Normandie, and presenting the letters
vnto the yoong gentlemen, vsed the matter so, that they thought verelie that this message had
béene sent from their mother, and wrote againe by them that brought the letters, that one of
them would not faile but come ouer vnto hir according to that she had requested, and
withall appointed the day and time. The messengers returning to king Harold, informed
him how they had sped. The yoonger brother Alfred, with his brothers consent, tooke with
him a certeine number of gentlemen and men of warre, and first came into Flanders, where
after he had remained a while with earle Baldwine, he increased his retinue with a few Bullogners,
and passed ouer into England, but approching to the shore, he was streightwaies
descried by his enimies, who hasted foorth to set vpon him; but perceiuing their drift, he bad
the ships cast about, and make againe to the sea; then landing at an other place, he ment to
go the next way to his mother.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Godwin was suspected to do this vnder a colour to betray him as by writers it séemeth.</span>
But earle Goodwine hearing of his arriuall, met him, receiued him into his assurance, and
binding his credit with a corporall oth, became his man, and therwith leading him out of
the high way that leadeth to London, he brought him to Gilford, where he lodged all the
strangers, by a score, a doozen, and halfe a score togither in innes, so as but a few remained
about the yoong gentleman Alfred to attend vpon him.  There was plentie of meat and
drinke prepared in euerie lodging, for the refreshing of all the companie. And Goodwine
taking his leaue for that night, departed to his lodging, promising the next morning to come
againe to giue his dutifull attendance on Alfred.</p>
<p>
But behold, after they had filled themselues with meats and drinks, and were gone to bed, in
<span class="rightnote">Not onelie Goodwine but other such as king Harold appointed, took Alfred with his Normans.</span>
the dead of the night came such as king Harold had appointed, and entring into euerie inne,
first seized vpon the armor and weapons that belonged to the strangers: which done, they
tooke them, and chained them fast with fetters and manacles, so kéeping them sure till the
next morning. Which being come, they were brought foorth with their hands bound behind
their backs, and deliuered to most cruell tormentors, who were commanded to spare
none but euerie tenth man, as he came to hand by lot, and so they slue nine and left the tenth aliue.
Of those that were left aliue, some they kept to serue as bondmen, other for couetousnesse of
gaine they sold, and some they put in prison, of whome yet diuerse afterwards escaped. This
with more hath the foresaid author written of this matter, declaring further, that Alfred being
conueied into the Ile of Elie, had not onelie his eies put out in most cruell wise, but was also
presentlie there murthered. But he speaketh not further of the maner how he was made away,
sauing that he saith he forbeareth to make long recitall of this matter, bicause he will not
renew the mothers gréefe in hearing it, sith there can be no greater sorrow to the mother than
to heare of hir sonnes death.</p>
<p>
¶ I remember in Caxton we read, that his cruell tormentors should cause his bellie to be
opened, &amp; taking out one end of his bowels or guts, tied the same to a stake which they had
set fast in the ground; then with néedels of iron pricking his bodie, they caused him to run
about the stake, till he had woond out all his intrailes, &amp; so ended he his innocent life, to the
great shame &amp; obloquie of his cruel aduersaries. But whether he was thus tormented or not, or
rather died (as I thinke) of the anguish by putting out his eies, no doubt but his death was reuenged
by Gods hand in those that procured it. But whether erle Goodwine was chéefe
causer thereof, in betraieng him vnder a cloked colour of pretended fréendship, I cannot say:
but that he tooke him and slue his companie, as some haue written, I cannot thinke it to be
true, both as well for that which ye haue heard recited out of the author that wrote "Encomium
Emmæ," as also for that it should séeme he might neuer be so directlie charged with it,
but that he had matter to alledge in his owne excuse. But now to other affaires of Harold.</p>

from the noble vertues of his father, following him in few things (except in exacting of
tributes and paiments.) He caused indeed eight markes of siluer to be leuied of euerie port

his spéedie death prouided well for his fame, bicause (as it was thought) if his life had
béene of long continuance, his infamie had béene the greater. But after he had reigned
foure yéeres, or (as other gathered) three yéeres and thrée moneths, he departed out of this

<h3>THE XV. CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">HARDICNUTE, or HARDIKNOUGHT.</span>
After that Harold was dead, all the nobles of the realme, both Danes and Englishmen
agréed to send for Hardiknought, the sonne of Canute by his wife quéene Emma, and to make
him king. Héere is to be noted, that by the death of king Canute, the state of things was
much altered in those countries of beyond the seas wherein he had the rule and dominion.
<span class="rightnote">Alteration in the state of things. <br /><i>Simon Dun.</i>, &amp; <br /><i>Matt. West.</i>
say, that he was at Bruges in Flanders with his mother when he was thus sent for,
having come thither to visit hir. <br />1041.</span>
For the Norwegians elected one Magnus, the sonne of Olauus to be their king, and the Danes
chose this Hardiknought, whome their writers name Canute the third, to be their gouernor.
This Hardiknought or Canute being aduertised of the death of his halfe brother Harold, and
that the lords of England had chosen him to their king, with all conuenient speed prepared a
nauie, and imbarking a certeine number of men of warre, tooke the sea, and had the wind so
fauorable for his purpose, that he arriued upon the coast of Kent the sixt day after he set out
of Denmarke, and so comming to London, was ioifullie receiued, and proclaimed king, and
crowned of Athelnotus archbishop of Canturburie, in the yere of our Lord 1041, in the first
yéere of the emperour Henrie the third, in the 9 yeere of Henrie the first of that name king of
France, and in the first yéere of Magfinloch, aliàs Machabeda king of Scotland. Incontinentlie
<span class="leftnote">Quéene Emma sent for.</span>
after his establishment in the rule of this realme, he sent into Flanders for his mother quéene
Emma, who during the time of hir banishment, had remained there. For Normandie in that
season was gouerned by the French king, by reason of the minoritie of duke William, surnamed
the bastard.</p>
<p>
Moreouer, in reuenge of the wrong offered to quéene Emma by hir sonne in law Harold,<a name="page737" id="page737"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;737]</span>
<span class="rightnote">The bodie of king Harold taken vp, and throwen into Thames.</span>
king Hardicnute did cause Alfrike archbishop of Yorke and earle Goodwine, with other noble
men to go to Westminster, and there to take vp the bodie of the same Harold, and withall
appointed, that the head thereof should be striken off, and the trunke of it cast into the
riuer of Thames. Which afterwards being found by fishers, was taken vp and buried in the
<span class="leftnote">S. Clement Danes.</span>
churchyard of S. Clement Danes without Temple barre at London. He committed the order
and gouernement of things to the hands of his mother Emma, and of Goodwine that was erle
<span class="rightnote"> <br />A tribute raised. <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i></span>
of Kent. He leuied a sore tribute of his subiects here in England to pay the souldiers and
mariners of his nauie, as first 21 thousand pounds, &amp; 99 pounds, and afterward vnto 32 ships
<span class="leftnote"><i>Simon Dun.</i> <br /><i>Wil. Malm.</i> <br /><i>Matth. West.</i> <br /><i>Sim. Dun.</i></span>
there was a paiment made of a 11 thousand and 48 pounds. To euerie mariner of his nauie
he caused a paiment of 8 marks to be made, and to euerie master 12 marks. About the paiment
of this monie great grudge grew amongst the people, insomuch that two of his seruants,
which were appointed collectors in the citie of Worcester, the one named Feader, and the
other Turstane, were there slaine. In reuenge of which contempt a great part of the countrie
with the citie was burnt, and the goods of the citizens put to the spoile by such power
of lords and men of warre as the king had sent against them.</p>
<p>
Shortlie after, Edward king Hardicnutes brother came foorth of Normandie to visit him
and his mother quéene Emma, of whome he was most ioifullie and honorablie welcomed and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt. West.</i> <br /><i>Ran. Higd.</i> <br /><i>Marianus</i>.</span>
interteined, and shortlie after made returne backe againe. It should appeare by some writers,
that after his comming ouer out of Normandie he remained still in the realme, so that
he was not in Normandie when his halfe brother Hardicnute died, but here in England:
<span class="leftnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
although other make other report, as after shall bée shewed. Also (as before ye haue heard)
some writers seeme to meane, that the elder brother Alfred came ouer at the same time. But
suerlie they are therein deceiued: for it was knowne well inough how tenderlie king Hardicnute
loued his brethren by the mothers side, so that there was not anie of the lords in his
<span class="rightnote"> <br />The bishop of Worcester accused for making away of Alfred.</span>
daies, that durst attempt anie such iniurie against them. True it is, that as well earle Goodwine,
as the bishop of Worcester (that was also put in blame and suspected for the apprehending
and making away of Alfred, as before ye haue heard) were charged by Hardicnute as culpable
in that matter, insomuch that the said bishop was expelled out of his sée by Hardicnute:
and after twelue moneths space was restored, by meanes of such summes of monie as he gaue
by waie of amends.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Earle Goodwin excuseth himselfe.</span>
Earle Goodwine was also put to his purgation, by taking an oth that he was not guiltie.
Which oth was the better allowed, by reason of such a present as he gaue to the king for the redéeming
<span class="leftnote">The gift which earle Goodwin gaue to the king.</span>
of his fauour and good will, that is to say, a ship with a sterne of gold, conteining therein 80
souldiers, wearing on each of their armes two bracelets of gold of 16 ounces weight, a triple
habergion guilt on their bodies, with guilt burgenets on their heads, a swoord with guilt hilts
girded to their wastes, a battell-axe after the maner of the Danes on their left shoulder, a target
with bosses and mails guilt in their left hand, a dart in their right hand: and thus to conclude,
they were furnished at all points with armor and weapon accordinglie. It hath béene said,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
that earle Goodwine minded to marie his daughter to one of these brethren, and perceiuing
that the elder brother Alfred would disdaine to haue hir, thought good to dispatch him, that
the other taking hir to wife, hée might be next heire to the crowne, and so at length inioy it,
as afterwards came to passe.</p>
<p>
Also about that time, when the linage of the kings of England was in maner extinct, the
English people were much carefull (as hath béene said) about the succession of those that
should inioie the crowne. Wherevpon as one Brightwold a moonke of Glastenburie, that
was afterward bishop of Wincester, or (as some haue written) of Worcester, studied oftentimes
thereon: it chanced that he dreamed one night as he slept in his bed, that he saw
saint Peter consecrate &amp; annoint Edward the sonne of Egelred (as then remaining in exile in
Normandie) king of England. And as he thought, he did demand of saint Peter, who should
succéed the said Edward? Wherevnto answer was made by the apostle; Haue thou no care
for such matters, for the kingdome of England is Gods kingdome. Which suerlie in good
earnest may appeare by manie great arguments to be full true vnto such as shall well consider<a name="page738" id="page738"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;738]</span>
the state of this realme from time to time, how there hath béene euer gouernours raised vp to
mainteine the maiestie of the kingdome, and to reduce the same to the former dignitie, when
by anie infortunate mishap it hath beene brought in danger.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The death of K. Hardicnute. <br /><i>Sim. Dunel.</i> <br /><i>Matth. West.</i> <br />1042.</span>
But to returne now to king Hardicnute, after he had reigned two yéers lacking 10 daies,
as he sat at the table in a great feast holden at Lambeth, he fell downe suddenlie with the pot
in his hand, and so died not without some suspicion of poison. This chanced on the 8 of Iune at
Lambeth aforesaid, where, on the same day a mariage was solemnized betwéene the ladie
Githa, the daughter of a noble man called Osgot Clappa, and a Danish lord also called Canute
Prudan. His bodie was buried at Winchester besides his father. He was of nature verie
<span class="leftnote">K. Hardicnute his conditions and liberalitie in housekeeping. <br /><i>Hen. Hunt.</i></span>
curteous, gentle and liberall, speciallie in keeping good chéere in his house, so that he would
haue his table couered foure times a day, &amp; furnished with great plentie of meates and drinks,
wishing that his seruants and all strangers that came to his palace, might rather leaue than
<span class="rightnote">Of whom the Englishmen learned excessiue féeding.</span>
want. It hath béene commonlie told, that Englishmen learned of him their excessiue gourmandizing
&amp; vnmeasurable filling of their panches with meates and drinkes, whereby they
forgat the vertuous vse of sobrietie, so much necessarie to all estates and degrées, so profitable
for all common-wealthes, and so commendable both in the sight of God, and all good men.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The end of the Danish rulers.</span>
In this Hardicnute ceased the rule of the Danes within this land, with the persecution which
they had executed against the English nation, for the space of 250 yeres &amp; more, that is to
say, euer since the tenth yeere of Brithrike the king of Westsaxons, at what time they first
began to inuade the English coasts. Howbeit (after others) they should séeme to haue ruled
here but 207, reckoning from their bringing in by the Welshmen in despite of the Saxons,
at which time they first began to inhabit here, which was 835 of Christ, 387 after the comming
of the Saxons, and 35 néere complet of the reigne of Egbert.</p>
<p>
¶ But to let this péece of curiositie passe, this land felt that they had a time of arriuall, a time of
inuading, a time of ouerrunning, and a time of ouerruling the inhabitants of this maine continent.
Wherof manifest proofes are at this day remaining in sundrie places, sundrie ruines I meane and
wastes committed by them; vpon the which whensoeuer a man of a relenting spirit casteth his
eie, he can not but enter into a dolefull consideration of former miseries, and lamenting the
defacements of this Ile by the crueltie of the bloudthirstie enimie, cannot but wish (if he haue
but "Minimam misericordiæ guttam quæ maior est spatioso oceano," as one saith) and earnestlie
desire in his heart that the like may neuer light vpon this land, but may be auerted and turned
away from all christian kingdomes, through his mercie, whose wrath by sinne being set on
fire, is like a consuming flame; and the swoord of whose vengeance being sharpened with the
whetstone of mens wickednesse, shall hew them in péeces as wood for the fornace.</p>
<p class="center">
<i>Thus farre the tumultuous and tyrannicall regiment of the Danes, inferring fulnesse of
afflictions to the English people, wherewith likewise the seuenth booke is shut vp.</i></p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
